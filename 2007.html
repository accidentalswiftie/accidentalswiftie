        <br>
        "Christmases When You Were Mine"<br>
        <br>
        Please take down the mistletoe<br>
        'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now<br>
        'Cause everything I want is miles away<br>
        In a snow covered little town<br>
        My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me<br>
        Season's greetings, hope you're well<br>
        Well I'm doing alright<br>
        If you were wondering<br>
        Lately I can never tell<br>
        <br>
        I know this shouldn't be a lonely time<br>
        But there were Christmases when you were mine<br>
        <br>
        I've been doing fine without you, really<br>
        Up until the nights got cold<br>
        And everybody's here, except you, baby<br>
        Seems like everyone's got someone to hold<br>
        <br>
        But for me it's just a lonely time<br>
        'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine<br>
        <br>
        Merry Christmas, everybody<br>
        That'll have to be something I just say this year<br>
        I'll bet you got your mom another sweater<br>
        And were your cousins late again?<br>
        When you were putting up the lights this year<br>
        Did you notice one less pair of hands?<br>
        <br>
        I know this shouldn't be a lonely time<br>
        But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight<br>
        'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine<br>
        <br>
        You were mine<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Christmas Must Be Something More"</h4>
        <br>
        What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?<br>
        Would the song still survive without five golden rings?<br>
        Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?<br>
        What would happen if God never let it snow?<br>
        What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?<br>
        Tell me, what would you find?<br>
        <br>
        You'd see that today holds something special<br>
        Something holy, not superficial<br>
        So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives<br>
        It's something we all try to ignore<br>
        And put a wreath up on your door<br>
        So here's something you should know that is for sure<br>
        Christmas must be something more<br>
        <br>
        What if angels did not pay attention to<br>
        All the things that we wished they would always do?<br>
        What if happiness came in a cardboard box?<br>
        Then I think there is something we all forgot<br>
        What would happen if presents all went away?<br>
        Tell me, what would you find?<br>
        <br>
        You'd see that today holds something special<br>
        Something holy, not superficial<br>
        So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives<br>
        It's something we all try to ignore<br>
        And put a wreath up on your door<br>
        So here's something you should know that is for sure<br>
        Christmas must be something more<br>
        <br>
        We get so caught up in all of it<br>
        Business and relationships<br>
        Hundred-mile-an-hour lives<br>
        And it's this time of year<br>
        And everybody's here<br>
        It seems the last thing on your mind<br>
        <br>
        Is that the day holds something special<br>
        Something holy, not superficial?<br>
        So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives<br>
        It's something we all try to ignore<br>
        And put a wreath up on your door<br>
        But here's something you should know that is for sure<br>
        Christmas must be something<br>
        Christmas must be something<br>
        Christmas must be something more<br>
        <br>
        There's gotta be more<br>
        There's gotta be more<br>
        <br>
