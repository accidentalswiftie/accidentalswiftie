        “reputation” (released November 10, 2017)<br>
        <br>
        "...Ready For It?"<br>
        <br>
        Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him<br>
        Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted<br>
        But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom<br>
        Holdin' him for ransom, some<br>
        Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though<br>
        Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so<br>
        I see nothing better, I keep him forever<br>
        Like a vendetta-ta<br>
        <br>
        I, I, I see how this is gon' go<br>
        Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
        I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
        No one has to know<br>
        <br>
        In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
        You should see the things we do, baby<br>
        In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
        I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time<br>
        Are you ready for it?<br>
        <br>
        Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me<br>
        Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry<br>
        But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and<br>
        We'll move to an island, and<br>
        And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor<br>
        Every love I've known in comparison is a failure<br>
        I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now<br>
        Never be the same now, now<br>
        <br>
        I, I, I see how this is gon' go<br>
        Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
        I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
        No one has to know (No one has to know)<br>
        <br>
        In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
        You should see the things we do, baby<br>
        In the middle of the night in my dreams<br>
        I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time<br>
        Are you ready for it?<br>

        I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        <br>
        Big reputation, big reputation<br>
        Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah<br>
        And you heard about me, ooh<br>
        I got some big enemies (Yeah)<br>
        Big reputation, big reputation<br>
        Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)<br>
        And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)<br>
        You like the bad ones, too<br>
        <br>
        You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast<br>
        We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat<br>
        I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)<br>
        I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)<br>
        I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)<br>
        I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)<br>
        You love it, I love it too 'cause you're my type (You're my type)<br>
        You hold me down and I protect you with my life<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be<br>
        Just another ex-love you don't wanna see<br>
        I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)<br>
        Like the other girls do<br>
        I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be<br>
        Drinking on a beach with you all over me<br>
        I know what they all say (I know what they all say)<br>
        But I ain't tryna play<br>
        <br>
        I wanna be your end game (End game)<br>
        I wanna be your first string (First string)<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        <br>
        Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older<br>
        Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders<br>
        Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep<br>
        The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me<br>
        Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long<br>
        And you understand the good and bad end up in the song<br>
        For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease<br>
        For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities<br>
        I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny<br>
        After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July<br>
        I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one<br>
        With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be<br>
        Just another ex-love you don't wanna see<br>
        I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)<br>
        Like the other girls do<br>
        I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be<br>
        Drinking on a beach with you all over me<br>
        I know what they all say, yeah<br>
        But I ain't tryna play<br>
        <br>
        I wanna be your end game (End game)<br>
        I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        <br>
        Big reputation, big reputation<br>
        Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah<br>
        And you heard about me, ooh<br>
        I got some big enemies<br>
        Hey, big reputation, big reputation<br>
        Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah<br>
        And I heard about you, ooh<br>
        You like the bad ones, too<br>
        <br>
        I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't<br>
        And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em<br>
        Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy<br>
        I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me<br>
        And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul<br>
        It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold<br>
        You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks<br>
        So here's the truth from my red lips<br>
        <br>
        I wanna be your end game (End game)<br>
        I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)<br>
        I wanna be your first string (First string)<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        <br>

        "I Did Something Bad"<br>
        <br>
        I never trust a narcissist, but they love me<br>
        So I play 'em like a violin<br>
        And I make it look—oh—so easy<br>
        <br>
        'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three<br>
        This is how the world works<br>
        Now all he thinks about is me<br>
        <br>
        I can feel the flames on my skin<br>
        Crimson-red paint on my lips<br>
        If a man talks shit<br>
        Then I owe him nothing<br>
        I don't regret it one bit<br>
        'Cause he had it coming<br>
        <br>
        They say I did something bad<br>
        Then why's it feel so good?<br>
        They say I did something bad<br>
        But why's it feel so good?<br>
        Most fun I ever had<br>
        And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could<br>
        It just felt so good, good<br>
        <br>
        I never trust a playboy, but they love me<br>
        So I fly 'em all around the world<br>
        And I let them think they saved me<br>
        <br>
        They never see it comin', what I do next<br>
        This is how the world works<br>
        You gotta leave before you get left<br>
        <br>
        I can feel the flames on my skin<br>
        He says, "Don't throw away a good thing."<br>
        But if he drops my name<br>
        Then I owe him nothin'<br>
        And if he spends my change<br>
        Then he had it comin'<br>
        <br>
        They say I did something bad<br>
        Then why's it feel so good?<br>
        They say I did something bad<br>
        But why's it feel so good?<br>
        Most fun I ever had<br>
        And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could<br>
        It just felt so good, good<br>
        <br>
        It just felt so good<br>
        <br>
        They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one<br>
        They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons<br>
        <br>
        They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one<br>
        So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)<br>
        Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)<br>
        <br>
        Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)<br>
        Light me up (light me up), light me up<br>
        <br>
        They say I did something bad (oh)<br>
        Then why's it feel so good? (so good)<br>
        They say I did something bad<br>
        But why's it feel so good?<br>
        Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)<br>
        And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could<br>
        It just felt so good (good), good<br>
        <br>
        Oh, you say I did something bad<br>
        (You say I did something bad?)<br>
        Why's it feel so good, good?<br>
        So bad, why's it feel so good?<br>
        Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (bad)<br>
        It just felt so good, good<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Don't Blame Me"<br>
        <br>
        Don't blame me<br>
        Love made me crazy<br>
        If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>

        My drug is my baby<br>
        I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
        <br>
        I've been breaking hearts a long time<br>
        And toying with them older guys<br>
        Just playthings for me to use<br>
        Something happened for the first time<br>
        In the darkest little paradise<br>
        Shaking, pacing, I just need you<br>
        <br>
        For you<br>
        I would cross the line<br>
        I would waste my time<br>
        I would lose my mind<br>
        They say, "She's gone too far this time."<br>
        <br>
        Don't blame me<br>
        Love made me crazy<br>

        <br>
        My name is whatever you decide<br>
        And I'm just gonna call you mine<br>
        I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)<br>
        Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind<br>
        Halo, hiding my obsession<br>
        I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy<br>
        <br>
        And, baby, for you<br>
        I would fall from grace<br>
        Just to touch your face<br>
        If you walk away<br>
        I'd beg you on my knees to stay<br>
        <br>

        "Delicate"<br>
        <br>
        This ain't for the best<br>
        My reputation's never been worse, so<br>
        You must like me for me<br>
        We can't make<br>
        Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
        But you can make me a drink<br>
        <br>
        Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?<br>
        Phone lights up my nightstand in the black<br>
        Come here, you can meet me in the back<br>
        Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you<br>
        Oh damn, never seen that color blue<br>
        Just think of the fun things we could do<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I like you<br>
        This ain't for the best<br>
        My reputation's never been worse, so<br>
        You must like me for me<br>
        Yeah, I want you<br>
        We can't make<br>
        Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
        But you can make me a drink<br>
        <br>
        Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
        Is it chill that you're in my head?<br>
        'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)<br>
        Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
        Is it too soon to do this yet?<br>
        'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
        Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?<br>
        Isn't it?<br>
        Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?<br>
        Isn't it?<br>
        Delicate<br>
        <br>
        Third floor on the West Side, me and you<br>
        Handsome, you're a mansion with a view<br>
        Do the girls back home touch you like I do?<br>
        Long night, with your hands up in my hair<br>
        Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs<br>
        Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I like you<br>
        This ain't for the best<br>
        My reputation's never been worse, so<br>
        You must like me for me<br>
        Yeah, I want you<br>
        We can't make<br>
        Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
        But you can make me a drink<br>
        <br>
        Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
        Is it chill that you're in my head?<br>
        'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)<br>
        Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
        Is it too soon to do this yet?<br>

        Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?<br>
        Isn't it?<br>
        Delicate<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes I wonder when you sleep<br>
        Are you ever dreaming of me?<br>
        Sometimes when I look into your eyes<br>
        I pretend you're mine, all the damn time<br>
        'Cause I like you<br>
        <br>
        Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
        Is it chill that you're in my head?<br>
        'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)<br>
        Yeah, I want you<br>

        "Look What You Made Me Do"<br>
        <br>
        I don't like your little games<br>
        Don't like your tilted stage<br>
        The role you made me play<br>
        Of the fool, no, I don't like you<br>
        I don't like your perfect crime<br>
        How you laugh when you lie<br>
        You said the gun was mine<br>
        Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)<br>
        <br>
        But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br>
        Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time<br>
        I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined<br>
        I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me<br>

        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        <br>
        I don't like your kingdom keys<br>
        They once belonged to me<br>
        You asked me for a place to sleep<br>
        Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)<br>
        The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama<br>
        But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma<br>
        And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure<br>
        Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours<br>
        <br>
        But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br>
        Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time<br>

        Look what you just made me do<br>
        <br>
        I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me<br>
        I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams<br>

        "So It Goes..."<br>
        <br>
        See you in the dark<br>
        All eyes on you, my magician<br>
        All eyes on us<br>
        You make everyone disappear, and<br>
        Cut me into pieces<br>
        Gold cage, hostage to my feelings<br>
        Back against the wall<br>
        Trippin', trip, trippin' when you're gone<br>
        <br>
        'Cause we break down a little<br>
        But when you get me alone, it's so simple<br>
        'Cause baby, I know what you know<br>
        We can feel it<br>
        <br>
        And all the pieces fall<br>
        Right into place<br>
        Getting caught up in a moment<br>
        Lipstick on your face<br>
        So it goes<br>
        I'm yours to keep<br>
        And I'm yours to lose<br>
        You know I'm not a bad girl, but I<br>
        Do bad things with you<br>
        So it goes<br>

        All eyes on me, your illusionist<br>
        All eyes on us<br>
        I make all your grey days clear and<br>
        Wear you like a necklace<br>
        I'm so chill, but you make me jealous<br>
        But I got your heart<br>
        Skippin', skip, skippin' when I'm gone<br>
        <br>
        'Cause we break down a little<br>

        "Gorgeous"<br>
        <br>
        Gorgeous<br>
        <br>
        You should take it as a compliment<br>
        That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk<br>
        You should think about the consequence<br>
        Of your magnetic field being a little too strong<br>
        And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us<br>
        He's in the club doing, I don't know what<br>
        You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)<br>
        <br>
        Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine<br>
        You've ruined my life by not being mine<br>
        <br>
        You're so gorgeous<br>
        I can't say anything to your face<br>
        'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)<br>
        And I'm so furious<br>
        At you for making me feel this way<br>
        But what can I say?<br>
        You're gorgeous<br>
        <br>
        You should take it as a compliment<br>
        That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)<br>
        And you should think about the consequence<br>
        Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)<br>
        If you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her<br>
        But if you're single that's honestly worse<br>
        'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts<br>
        (Honey, it hurts)<br>
        <br>
        Ocean blue eyes looking in mine<br>
        I feel like I might sink and drown and die<br>

        And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)<br>
        You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)<br>
        There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and<br>
        Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone<br>
        Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)<br>
        <br>
        You're so gorgeous<br>
        I can't say anything to your face (To your face)<br>

        "Getaway Car"<br>
        <br>
        No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
        <br>
        It was the best of times, the worst of crimes<br>
        I struck a match and blew your mind<br>
        But I didn't mean it<br>
        And you didn't see it<br>
        The ties were black, the lies were white<br>
        In shades of gray in candlelight<br>
        I wanted to leave him<br>
        I needed a reason<br>
        <br>
        "X" marks the spot, where we fell apart<br>
        He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself<br>
        I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
        We never had a shotgun shot in the dark<br>
        <br>
        You were driving the getaway car<br>
        We were flying, but we'd never get far<br>
        Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
        Think about the place where you first met me<br>
        We're riding in a getaway car<br>
        There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
        Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
        Think about the place where you first met me<br>
        In a getaway car<br>
        No, they never get far<br>
        No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
        <br>
        It was the great escape, the prison break<br>
        The light of freedom on my face<br>
        But you weren't thinking<br>
        And I was just drinking<br>
        Well he was running after us, I was screaming, 'Go, go, go!'<br>
        But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow<br>
        And a circus ain't a love story<br>
        And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)<br>
        <br>
        "X" marks the spot, where we fell apart<br>
        He poisoned the well, every man for himself<br>
        I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
        It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart<br>

        We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde<br>
        Until I switched to the other side<br>
        To the other side<br>
        It's no surprise, I turned you in<br>
        'Cause us traitors never win<br>
        <br>
        I'm in a getaway car<br>
        I left you in a motel bar<br>
        Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys<br>
        That was the last time you ever saw me<br>
        <br>
        Driving the getaway car<br>
        We were flying, but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)<br>

        I was riding in a getaway car<br>
        I was crying in a getaway car<br>
        I was dying in a getaway car<br>
        Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car<br>

        <br>
        I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own<br>
        I made up my mind, I'm better off being alone<br>
        We met a few weeks ago<br>
        Now you try on callin' me "baby" like tryin' on clothes<br>
        <br>
        Salute to me I'm your American Queen<br>
        And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat<br>
        And we rule the kingdom inside my room<br>
        'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars<br>
        With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars<br>
        Never took me quite where you do<br>
        <br>
        And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for<br>
        King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go<br>
        King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa<br>

        And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting<br>
        Ooh whoa, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting<br>
        Body and soul, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once<br>
        <br>
        Late in the night, the city's asleep<br>
        Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep<br>
        Change my priorities<br>
        The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury<br>
        <br>
        Salute to me I'm your American Queen<br>
        And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat<br>
        And we rule the kingdom inside my room<br>
        (Inside my room, oh)<br>
        'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars<br>
        With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars<br>
        Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)<br>
        <br>
        And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for<br>
        King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go<br>
        King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa<br>
        <br>
        And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)<br>
        Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once, you are the one<br>
        I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)<br>
        Body and soul, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once<br>
        <br>
        Is this the end of all the endings?<br>
        My broken bones are mending<br>
        With all these nights we're spending<br>
        Up on the roof with a school girl crush<br>
        Drinking beer out of plastic cups<br>
        Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff<br>
        Baby, all at once, this is enough<br>
        <br>
        And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for<br>
        King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for<br>
        King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go<br>
        King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa<br>
        <br>
        And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting<br>
        Ooh whoa, ooh whoa<br>
        And all at once<br>
        'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting<br>
        Body and soul, ooh whoa<br>

        "Dancing With Our Hands Tied"<br>
        <br>
        I, I loved you in secret<br>
        First sight, yeah, we love without reason<br>
        Oh, 25 years old<br>
        Oh, how were you to know and<br>
        <br>
        My, my love had been frozen<br>
        Deep blue, but you painted me golden<br>
        Oh, and you held me close<br>
        Oh, how was I to know what<br>
        <br>
        I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
        Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
        You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
        I had a bad feeling<br>
        And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis<br>
        People started talking, putting us through our paces<br>
        I knew there was no one in the world who could take it<br>
        I had a bad feeling<br>
        <br>
        But we were dancing<br>
        Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
        Like it was the first time, first time<br>
        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
        Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
        And I had a bad feeling<br>
        But we were dancing<br>
        <br>
        I, I loved you in spite of<br>
        Deep fears that the world would divide us<br>
        So, baby, can we dance<br>
        Oh, through an avalanche?<br>
        And say, say that we got it<br>
        I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted<br>
        Oh, 'cause it's gravity<br>
        Oh, keeping you with me<br>
        <br>
        I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
        Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
        You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
        I had a bad feeling<br>
        <br>
        But we were dancing<br>

        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
        Like it was the first time, first time<br>
        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
        Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
        (Ooh, we had our hands tied)<br>
        And I had a bad feeling<br>
        But we were dancing<br>
        <br>
        I'd kiss you as the lights went out<br>
        Swaying as the room burned down<br>
        I'd hold you as the water rushes in<br>
        If I could dance with you again<br>
        I'd kiss you as the lights went out<br>
        Swaying as the room burned down<br>
        I'd hold you as the water rushes in<br>
        If I could dance with you again (Again)<br>
        <br>
        Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
        Oh, yeah, we were dancing<br>
        Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)<br>
        Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)<br>
        Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
        (Dancing with our hands tied)<br>
        Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)<br>
        And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)<br>
        But we were dancing<br>
        <br>
        (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
        Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)<br>

        "Dress"<br>
        <br>
        Our secret moments in a crowded room<br>
        They got no idea about me and you<br>
        There is an indentation in the shape of you<br>
        Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo<br>
        <br>
        All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation<br>
        My hands are shaking from holding back from you<br>
        Ha, ah, ah<br>
        All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting<br>
        My hands are shaking from all this<br>
        Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah<br>
        <br>
        Say my name and everything just stops<br>
        I don't want you like a best friend<br>
        Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>
        Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah<br>
        Carve your name into my bedpost<br>
        'Cause I don't want you like a best friend<br>
        Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>
        Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah<br>
        <br>
        Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try<br>
        And if I get burned, at least we were electrified<br>
        I'm spilling wine in the bathtub<br>
        You kiss my face and we're both drunk<br>
        Everyone thinks that they know us<br>
        But they know nothing about—<br>
        <br>
        All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation<br>
        My hands are shaking from holding back from you<br>
        Ha, ah, ah<br>

        Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>
        <br>
        Flashback when you met me<br>
        Your buzzcut and my hair bleached<br>
        Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me<br>
        Flashback to my mistakes<br>
        My rebounds, my earthquakes<br>
        Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me<br>
        And I woke up just in time<br>
        Now I wake up by your side<br>
        My one and only, my lifeline<br>
        I woke up just in time<br>
        Now I wake up by your side<br>

        "This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things" <br>
        <br>
        It was so nice throwing big parties<br>
        Jump into the pool from the balcony<br>
        Everyone swimming in a champagne sea<br>
        And there are no rules when you show up here<br>
        Bass beat rattling the chandelier<br>
        Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year<br>
        <br>
        So why'd you have to rain on my parade?<br>
        I'm shaking my head and locking the gates<br>
        <br>
        This is why we can't have nice things, darling<br>
        Because you break them<br>
        I had to take them away<br>
        This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)<br>
        Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
        This is why we can't have nice things<br>
        <br>
        It was so nice being friends again<br>
        There I was, giving you a second chance<br>
        But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand<br>
        And therein lies the issue<br>
        Friends don't try to trick you<br>
        Get you on the phone and mind-twist you<br>
        And so I took an axe to a mended fence<br>
        <br>
        But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)<br>
        If only you weren't so shady<br>
        <br>
        This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)<br>
        Because you break them<br>
        I had to take them away<br>
        This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey<br>
        Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
        This is why we can't have<br>
        <br>
        Here's a toast to my real friends<br>
        They don't care about the he-said, she-said<br>
        And here's to my baby<br>
        He ain't reading what they call me lately<br>
        And here's to my mama<br>
        Had to listen to all this drama<br>
        And here's to you<br>
        'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do<br>
        Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face<br>
        <br>
        This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)<br>
        Because you break them<br>
        I had to take them away<br>
        This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)<br>
        Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
        This is why we can't have nice things, darling<br>
        (And here's to my real friends)<br>
        Because you break them<br>
        I had to take them<br>
        (And here's to my baby)<br>
        Nice things, honey<br>
        (They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)<br>
        Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
        This is why we can't have nice things<br>

        "Call It What You Want"<br>
        <br>
        My castle crumbled overnight<br>
        I brought a knife to a gunfight<br>
        They took the crown but it's alright<br>
        All the liars are calling me one<br>
        Nobody's heard from me for months<br>
        I'm doing better than I ever was<br>
        <br>
        'Cause<br>
        My baby's fit like a daydream<br>
        Walking with his head down<br>
        I'm the one he's walking to<br>
        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
        Call it what you want to<br>
        My baby's fly like a jet stream<br>
        High above the whole scene<br>
        Loves me like I'm brand new<br>
        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
        Call it what you want to<br>
        <br>
        All my flowers grew back as thorns<br>
        Windows boarded up after the storm<br>
        He built a fire just to keep me warm<br>
        All the drama queens taking swings<br>
        All the jokers dressing up as kings<br>
        They fade to nothing when I look at him<br>
        And I know I make the same mistakes every time<br>
        Bridges burn, I never learn<br>
        At least I did one thing right<br>
        I did one thing right<br>
        I'm laughing with my lover<br>
        Making forts under covers<br>
        Trust him like a brother<br>
        Yeah, you know I did one thing right<br>
        Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night<br>
        <br>
        My baby's fit like a daydream<br>
        Walking with his head down<br>
        I'm the one he's walking to<br>
        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
        Call it what you want to<br>
        My baby's fly like a jet stream<br>
        High above the whole scene<br>
        Loves me like I'm brand new<br>

        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
        Call it what you want to<br>
        <br>
        I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck<br>
        Chain 'round my neck<br>
        Not because he owns me<br>
        But 'cause he really knows me<br>
        Which is more than they can say, I<br>
        I recall late November, holding my breath<br>
        Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me<br>
        But would you run away with me?"<br>
        Yes (would you run away?)<br>
        <br>
        My baby's fit like a daydream<br>
        Walking with his head down<br>
        I'm the one he's walking to<br>
        (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)<br>
        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
        Call it what you want to<br>
        My baby's fly like a jet stream<br>
        High above the whole scene<br>

        Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby<br>

        You and me from the night before, but<br>
        <br>
        Don't read the last page<br>
        But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared<br>
