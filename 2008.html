        <h4>"Beautiful Eyes"</h4>
        <br>
        Your beautiful eyes<br>
        Stare right into my eyes<br>
        And sometimes I think of you late at night<br>
        I don't know why, I<br>
        <br>
        I wanna be somewhere where you are<br>
        I wanna be where<br>
        <br>
        You're here, your eyes are looking into mine<br>
        So baby, make me fly<br>
        My heart has never felt this way before<br>
        I'm looking through your<br>
        I'm looking through your eyes<br>
        <br>
        I wake up, I'm alive<br>
        In only a little while I'll cry<br>
        'Cause you're my lullaby<br>
        So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I-I<br>
        <br>
        I wanna be everything you need<br>
        I wanna be where<br>
        <br>
        You're here, your eyes are looking into mine<br>
        So baby, make me fly<br>
        My heart has never felt this way before<br>
        I'm looking through your<br>
        I'm looking through your eyes<br>
        <br>
        Just as long as you're mine<br>
        I'll be your everything tonight<br>
        Let me love you, kiss you<br>
        Oh, baby, let me miss you<br>
        Let me see your<br>
        Dream about, dream about<br>
        Dream about your eyes<br>
        Eyes, eyes<br>
        Beautiful eyes<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"I Heart ?"</h4>
        <br>
        Wish I had concentrated<br>
        They said love was complicated<br>
        But it's something I just fell into<br>
        And it was overrated<br>
        But just look what I created<br>
        I keep my life in black and blue<br>
        Before you ask me if I'm alright<br>
        Think about what I had to do, ooh yeah<br>
        <br>
        Wake up and smell the breakup<br>
        Fix my heart, put on my make-up<br>
        Another mess I didn't plan<br>
        And I'll bet you thought you beat me<br>
        Wish you could only see<br>
        I got an I heart question mark<br>
        Written on the back of my hand<br>
        <br>
        I'll be fine if you just walk by<br>
        But you had to talk about why<br>
        You were wrong and I was right<br>
        But I can't believe you made me<br>
        Sit at home, cry like a baby<br>
        Wait right by the phone every night<br>
        <br>
        And now you ask about you and I<br>
        There's no you and I<br>
        Remember what you put me through<br>
        <br>
        I had to wake up and smell the breakup<br>
        Fix my heart, put on my make-up<br>
        Another mess I didn't plan<br>
        And I'll bet you thought you beat me<br>
        Wish you could only see<br>
        I got an I heart question mark<br>
        Written on the back of my hand<br>
        <br>
        And when you're home all alone at night<br>
        You'll still wonder why<br>
        You took everything I had, oh baby<br>
        I haven't thought about you and I<br>
        There's no you and I<br>
        And I know someday you will<br>
        <br>
        Wake up and smell the breakup<br>
        Realize that we won't make-up<br>
        It didn't go the way you planned<br>
        And you'll know you didn't beat me<br>
        When you look down and see<br>
        I got an I heart question mark written on the back of my hand<br>
        <br>
        Written on the back of my hand<br>
        An I heart question mark, yeah<br>
        Written on the back of my hand<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h4>"Fearless (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        There's something 'bout the way<br>
        The street looks when it's just rained<br>
        There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car<br>
        And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there<br>
        In the middle of the parking lot, yeah<br>
        Oh, yeah<br>
        <br>
        We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know<br>
        I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now<br>
        But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair<br>
        Absent-mindedly making me want you<br>
        <br>
        And I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
        You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless<br>
        And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
        In a storm in my best dress, fearless<br>
        <br>
        So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one-horse town<br>
        I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat<br>
        You put your eyes on me<br>
        In this moment now, capture it, remember it<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
        You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless<br>
        And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
        In a storm in my best dress, fearless<br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        Well, you stood there with me in the doorway<br>
        My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but<br>
        You pull me in and I'm a little more brave<br>
        It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something<br>
        It's fearless<br>
        Oh, yeah<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
        You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless<br>
        And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
        In a storm in my best dress, fearless<br>
        'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
        You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless<br>
        And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
        In a storm in my best dress, fearless<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        Oh-oh, yeah<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Fifteen (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors<br>
        It's the mornin' of your very first day<br>
        You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while<br>
        Try and stay out of everybody's way<br>
        It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here<br>
        For the next four years in this town<br>
        Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say<br>
        "You know, I haven't seen you around before"<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out<br>
        Well, count to ten, take it in<br>
        This is life before you know who you're gonna be<br>
        Fifteen<br>
        <br>
        You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail<br>
        And soon enough, you're best friends<br>
        Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool<br>
        We'll be outta here as soon as we can<br>
        And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car<br>
        And you're feelin' like flyin'<br>
        And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one<br>
        And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends<br>
        When the night ends<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        And when you're fifteen and your first kiss<br>
        Makes your head spin 'round<br>
        But in your life you'll do things greater than<br>
        Dating the boy on the football team<br>
        But I didn't know it at fifteen<br>
        <br>
        When all you wanted was to be wanted<br>
        Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now<br>
        Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday<br>
        But I realized some bigger dreams of mine<br>
        And Abigail gave everything she had<br>
        To a boy who changed his mind<br>
        And we both cried<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall<br>
        I've found time can heal most anything<br>
        And you just might find who you're supposed to be<br>
        I didn't know who I was supposed to be<br>
        At fifteen<br>
        <br>
        La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la<br>
        La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la<br>
        La-la-la, la-la-la<br>
        <br>
        Your very first day<br>
        Take a deep breath, girl<br>
        Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Love Story (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        We were both young when I first saw you<br>
        I close my eyes and the flashback starts<br>
        I'm standing there<br>
        On a balcony in summer air<br>
        See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
        See you make your way through the crowd<br>
        And say, "Hello"<br>
        Little did I know<br>
        <br>
        That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles<br>
        And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
        And I was crying on the staircase<br>
        Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said<br>
        <br>
        Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
        I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
        You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
        It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
        <br>
        So I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>
        We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>
        So close your eyes<br>
        Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter<br>
        And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
        But you were everything to me<br>
        I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said<br>
        <br>
        Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
        I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
        You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
        It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
        Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel<br>
        This love is difficult, but it's real<br>
        Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess<br>
        It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        And I got tired of waiting<br>
        Wondering if you were ever coming around<br>
        My faith in you was fading<br>
        When I met you on the outskirts of town<br>
        <br>
        And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone<br>
        I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>
        Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"<br>
        He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said<br>
        "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone<br>
        I love you and that's all I really know<br>
        I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress<br>
        It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        'Cause we were both young when I first saw you<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Hey Stephen (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        Mmm-mm, mm-mm<br>
        Mmm-mm, mm-mm<br>
        Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah<br>
        <br>
        Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving<br>
        But I know I saw a light in you<br>
        And as we walked we were talking<br>
        I didn't say half the things I wanted to<br>
        Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window<br>
        I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold<br>
        Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing<br>
        I don't always have to be alone<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel<br>
        Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so<br>
        Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br>
        Can't help it if there's no one else<br>
        Mmm, I can't help myself<br>
        <br>
        Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling<br>
        So I got some things to say to you<br>
        I've seen it all, so I thought<br>
        But I never seen nobody shine the way you do<br>
        The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name<br>
        It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change<br>
        Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?<br>
        I think you and I should stay the same<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel<br>
        Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so<br>
        Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br>
        Can't help it if there's no one else<br>
        Mmm, I can't help myself<br>
        <br>
        They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me<br>
        Why aren't you here tonight?<br>
        I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out<br>
        And pull me near and shine, shine, shine<br>
        Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons<br>
        Why I should be the one you choose<br>
        All those other girls, well, they're beautiful<br>
        But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)<br>
        <br>
        I can't help it if you look like an angel<br>
        Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so<br>
        Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br>
        Can't help it if there's no one else<br>
        Mmm, I can't help myself<br>
        If you look like an angel<br>
        Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so<br>
        Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br>
        Can't help it if there's no one else<br>
        Mmm, I can't help myself<br>
        <br>
        Ah-uh, myself<br>
        Mmm-mm, I can't help myself<br>
        I can't help myself<br>
        Oh-oh-oh<br>
        Mmm-mm, mm-mm<br>
        Mmm-mm, mm-mm<br>
        Mmm-mm, mm-mm<br>

        <h4>"White Horse (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        Say you're sorry, that face of an angel<br>
        Comes out just when you need it to<br>
        As I paced back and forth all this time<br>
        'Cause I honestly believed in you<br>
        Holdin' on, the days drag on<br>
        Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known<br>
        <br>
        That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale<br>
        I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell<br>
        This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town<br>
        I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br>
        Now it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
        To come around<br>
        <br>
        Maybe I was naïve, got lost in your eyes<br>
        And never really had a chance<br>
        My mistake, I didn't know to be in love<br>
        You had to fight to have the upper hand<br>
        I had so many dreams about you and me<br>
        Happy endings, now I know<br>
        <br>
        That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale<br>
        I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell<br>
        This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town<br>
        I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br>
        Now it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
        To come around<br>
        <br>
        And there you are on your knees<br>
        Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me<br>
        Just like I always wanted<br>
        But I'm so sorry<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale<br>
        I'm gonna find someone someday<br>
        Who might actually treat me well<br>
        This is a big world, that was a small town<br>
        There in my rear view mirror disappearing now<br>
        And it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
        Now it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
        To catch me now<br>
        <br>
        Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
        Try and catch me now, oh<br>
        It's too late to catch me now<br>

        <h4>"You Belong With Me (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset<br>
        She's going off about something that you said<br>
        'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do<br>
        I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night<br>
        I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like<br>
        And she'll never know your story like I do<br>
        <br>
        'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts<br>
        She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers<br>
        Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find<br>
        That what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br>
        <br>
        If you could see that I'm the one who understands you<br>
        Been here all along, so why can't you see?<br>
        You belong with me, you belong with me<br>
        <br>
        Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans<br>
        I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be<br>
        Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself<br>
        Hey, isn't this easy?<br>
        And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town<br>
        I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down<br>
        You say you're fine, I know you better than that<br>
        Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?<br>
        <br>
        She wears high heels, I wear sneakers<br>
        She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers<br>
        Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
        That what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br>
        <br>
        If you could see that I'm the one who understands you<br>
        Been here all along, so why can't you see?<br>
        You belong with me<br>
        Standing by and waiting at your back door<br>
        All this time how could you not know, baby?<br>
        You belong with me, you belong with me<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I remember you driving to my house<br>
        In the middle of the night<br>
        I'm the one who makes you laugh<br>
        When you know you're 'bout to cry<br>
        I know your favorite songs<br>
        And you tell me 'bout your dreams<br>
        Think I know where you belong<br>
        Think I know it's with me<br>
        <br>
        Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you<br>
        Been here all along, so why can't you see?<br>
        You belong with me<br>
        Standing by and waiting at your back door<br>
        All this time how could you not know, baby?<br>
        You belong with me, you belong with me<br>
        <br>
        You belong with me<br>
        Have you ever thought just maybe<br>
        You belong with me?<br>
        You belong with me<br>

            (feat. Colbie Caillat)</h4>
        <br>
        I see your face in my mind as I drive away<br>
        'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way<br>
        People are people and sometimes we change our minds<br>
        But it's killing me to see you go after all this time<br>
        <br>
        Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm<br>
        Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm<br>
        <br>
        The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie<br>
        It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see<br>
        'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down<br>
        Now I don't know what to be without you around<br>
        <br>
        And we know it's never simple, never easy<br>
        Never a clean break, no one here to save me<br>
        You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand<br>
        <br>
        And I can't breathe without you, but I have to<br>
        Breathe without you, but I have to<br>
        <br>
        Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt<br>
        Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve<br>
        But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out<br>
        And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout<br>
        <br>
        And we know it's never simple, never easy<br>
        Never a clean break, no one here to save me<br>
        You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand<br>
        <br>
        And I can't breathe without you, but I have to<br>
        Breathe without you but I have to<br>
        <br>
        It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend<br>
        Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me<br>
        It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend<br>
        Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me<br>

        I took a chance, I took a shot<br>
        And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not<br>
        You took a swing, I took it hard<br>
        And down here from the ground, I see who you are<br>

        So you can feel whole inside?<br>
        Why do you have to put down my dreams<br>
        So you're the only thing on my mind?<br>

        He says everything I need to hear and it's like<br>
        I couldn't ask for anything better<br>

        Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide<br>
        Like a scared little boy?<br>
        I looked into your eyes<br>
        Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure<br>
        So here's to everything coming down to nothing<br>
        Here's to silence that cuts me to the core<br>
        Where is this going?<br>
        Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore<br>

        I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on<br>
        I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run<br>
        Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides<br>
        Look now, the sky is gold<br>
        I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home<br>
        <br>
        I don't know why all the trees change in the fall<br>
        But I know you're not scared of anything at all<br>
        Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away<br>
        But I know I had the best day with you today<br>
        <br>
        I'm thirteen now<br>
        And don't know how my friends could be so mean<br>
        I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys<br>
        And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away<br>
        And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names<br>
        <br>
        I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school<br>
        But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you<br>
        Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay<br>
        But I know I had the best day with you today<br>

        I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger<br>
        God smiles on my little brother, inside and out<br>

        <br>
        There is a video I found from back when I was three<br>
        You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me<br>
        It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs<br>
        And Daddy's smart<br>
        And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world<br>
        <br>
        And now I know why all the trees change in the fall<br>
        I know you were on my side even when I was wrong<br>
        And I love you for giving me your eyes<br>
        For staying back and watching me shine<br>
        And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say<br>
        That I had the best day with you today<br>

        <h4>"Change (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you<br>
        Somebody else gets what you wanted again and<br>
        You know it's all the same, another time and place<br>
        Repeating history and you're getting sick of it<br>
        But I believe in whatever you do<br>
        And I'll do anything to see it through<br>
        <br>
        Because these things will change<br>
        Can you feel it now?<br>
        These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down<br>
        This revolution, the time will come<br>
        For us to finally win<br>
        And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah<br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered<br>
        It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair<br>
        We're getting stronger now, find things they never found<br>
        They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared<br>
        You can walk away, say we don't need this<br>
        But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this<br>
        <br>
        'Cause these things will change<br>
        Can you feel it now?<br>
        These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down<br>
        This revolution, the time will come<br>
        For us to finally win<br>
        And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah<br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees<br>
        Fight for what we've worked for all these years<br>
        And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives<br>
        But we'll stand up champions tonight<br>
        <br>
        It was the night things changed<br>
        Can you see it now?<br>
        When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down<br>
        It's a revolution, throw your hands up<br>
        'Cause we never gave in<br>
        And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah<br>
        Hallelujah<br>

        I had time to think it o-over<br>
        And all I can say is come closer<br>

        I'll catch you<br>
        The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry<br>
        But I'll hold you through the night until you smile<br>

        Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement<br>
        Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do<br>
        The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads<br>
        They leave 'em muddy underneath<br>

        You can't change where it's been<br>

        Well, I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child<br>
        Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then<br>
        <br>
        And I lived, and I learned<br>
        Had you, got burned<br>
        Held out, and held on<br>
        God knows, too long<br>
        And wasted time, lost tears<br>
        Swore that I'd get out of here<br>
        But no amount of freedom gets you clean<br>
        I've still got you all over me<br>
        <br>
        I lived, and I learned<br>
        And found out what it was to turn around<br>
        And see, that we<br>
        Were never really meant to be<br>
        So I lied, and I cried<br>
        And I watched a part of myself die<br>
        'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean<br>
        I've still got you all over me<br>
        I've still got you all over me<br>
        Still got you all over me<br>

        <br>
        Mr. "Perfect face"<br>
        Mr. "Here to stay"<br>
        Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"<br>
        Everything was right<br>
        Mr. "I've been waiting for you all my life"<br>
        Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"<br>
        <br>
        But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"<br>
        Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart<br>
        It takes everything in me just to get up each day<br>
        But it's wonderful to see that you're okay<br>
        <br>
        Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"<br>
        How's your heart after breaking mine?<br>
        Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby<br>
        Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"<br>
        Mr. "Everything revolves around you"<br>
        I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye<br>
        And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"<br>
        <br>
        Mr. "Never told me why"<br>
        Mr. "Never had to see me cry"<br>
        Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"<br>
        He goes about his day<br>
        Forgets he ever even heard my name<br>
        Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl<br>
        I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her<br>
        And I never got past what you put me through<br>
        But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you<br>
        <br>
        Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"<br>
        How's your heart after breakin' mine?<br>
        Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby<br>
        Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"<br>
        Mr. "Everything revolves around you"<br>
        I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye<br>
        And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"<br>
        <br>
        So dignified in your well-pressed suit<br>
        So strategized, all the eyes on you<br>
        Sashay away to your seat<br>
        It's the best seat, in the best room<br>
        Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"<br>
        So far above me in every sense<br>
        So far above feeling anything<br>
        <br>
        And it's really such a shame<br>
        It's such a shame<br>
        'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"<br>
        Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"<br>
        And someday maybe you'll miss me<br>
        But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"<br>
        <br>
        Goodbye Mr. "Perfectly fine"<br>
        How's your heart after breakin' mine?<br>
        Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby<br>
        Goodbye Mr. "Casually cruel"<br>
        Mr. "Everything revolves around you"<br>
        I've been Miss "Misery" for the last time<br>
        And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"<br>
        You're perfectly fine<br>
        Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"<br>

        <h4>"We Were Happy (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"</h4>
        <br>
        We used to walk along the streets<br>
        When the porch lights were shining bright<br>
        Before I had somewhere to be<br>
        Back when we had all night and we were happy<br>
        I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus<br>
        You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it<br>
        And we were happy<br>
        <br>
        When it was good, baby, it was good, baby<br>
        We showed 'em all up<br>
        No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark<br>
        Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday<br>
        And we were happy<br>
        <br>
        We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water<br>
        That's sorta how I feel right now<br>
        And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy<br>
        <br>
        When it was good, baby, it was good, baby<br>
        We showed 'em all up<br>
        No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark<br>
        Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday<br>
        And we were happy<br>
        We were happy<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore<br>
        But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for<br>
        'Cause we were happy, we were happy<br>
        <br>
        When it was good, baby, it was good, baby<br>
        We showed 'em all up<br>
        No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark<br>
        Talking 'bout your daddy's farm<br>
        And you were gonna marry me<br>
        And we were happy<br>
        Yeah, we were happy<br>
        Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
        We were happy<br>

        <br>
        You said, "I know"<br>
        When I said, "I need some time, need some space<br>
        To think about all of this"<br>
        You watched me go<br>
        And I knew my<br>
        Words were hard to hear<br>
        And harder to ever take back<br>
        And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"<br>
        <br>
        And you said that's when<br>
        When I wake up in the morning<br>
        That's when, when it's sunny or storming<br>
        Laughing, when I'm crying<br>
        And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate<br>
        That's when, when I see your face<br>
        I'll let you in, and baby, that's when<br>
        Mm, mm<br>
        <br>
        I said, "I know"<br>
        When you said, "I did you wrong<br>
        Made mistakes<br>
        And put you through all of this" (through all of this)<br>
        Then through the phone<br>
        Came all your tears<br>
        And I said, "Leave those all in our past"<br>
        And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"<br>
        <br>

        I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"<br>
        <br>
        And you said, "Honestly<br>
        When you were gone<br>
        Did you ever think of me?"<br>
        And I said<br>
        <br>
        "That's when, when I woke up in the morning<br>

        When I'm laughing, when I'm crying<br>
        That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate<br>

        <br>
        Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere<br>
        It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare<br>
        I heard she's nothin' like me<br>
        I'm sure she'll make you happy<br>
        <br>
        But don't you<br>
        Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been<br>
        Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again<br>
        You don't know how much I feel I love you still<br>
        So why don't you, don't you?<br>
        <br>
        Ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you<br>
        I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do<br>
        My heart knows what the truth is<br>
        I swore I wouldn't do this<br>
        <br>
        But don't you<br>
        Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been<br>
        Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again<br>
        You don't know how much I feel I love you still<br>
        So why don't you, don't you?<br>
        <br>
        So I walk outta here tonight<br>
        Try to go on with my life<br>
        And you can say, "We're still friends"<br>
        I don't wanna pretend<br>
        So if I see you again<br>
        <br>
        Don't you (Don't you)<br>
        Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been<br>
        Don't you (Don't you), say you've missed me if you don't want me again<br>
        You don't (You don't), know how much I feel I love you still<br>
        So why don't you, don't you?<br>

        <br>
        It wasn't just like a movie<br>
        The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin<br>
        I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say<br>
        This is the last time I'll drive this way again<br>
        Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray<br>
        'Cause I, I still love you but I can't<br>
        <br>
        Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side<br>
        Bye, bye, baby<br>
        I want you back but it's come down to nothing<br>
        And all I have is your sympathy<br>
        'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me<br>
        Bye, bye, baby<br>
        Bye, bye, baby<br>
        <br>
        The picture frame is empty<br>
        On the dresser, vacant just like me<br>
        I see your writing on the dash<br>
        Then back to your hesitation<br>
        I was so sure of everything<br>
        Everything I thought we'd always have<br>
        Guess I never doubted it<br>
        Then the here and the now floods in<br>
        Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past<br>
        <br>
        Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side<br>
        Bye, bye, baby<br>
        I want you back but it's come down to nothing<br>

        'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me<br>
        Bye, bye, baby<br>
        <br>
        And there's so much that I can't touch<br>
        You're all I want but it's not enough this time<br>
        And all the pages are just slipping through my hands<br>
        And I'm so scared of how this ends<br>
        <br>
        Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side<br>
        Bye, bye, baby<br>
        I want you back but it's come down to nothing<br>
