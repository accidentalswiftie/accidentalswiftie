        "Only The Young"<br>
        <br>
        It keeps me awake<br>
        The look on your face<br>
        The moment you heard the news<br>
        You're screaming inside<br>
        And frozen in time<br>
        You did all that you could do<br>
        The game was rigged, the ref got tricked<br>
        The wrong ones think they're right<br>
        You were outnumbered — this time<br>
        <br>
        But only the young<br>
        Only the young<br>
        Only the young<br>
        Only the young can run<br>
        Can run, so run<br>
        And run, and run<br>
        <br>
        So every day now<br>
        You brace for the sound<br>
        You've only heard on TV<br>
        You go to class, scared<br>
        Wondering where the best hiding spot would be<br>
        And the big bad man and his big bad clan<br>
        Their hands are stained with red<br>
        Oh, how quickly, they forget<br>
        <br>
        They aren't gonna help us<br>
        Too busy helping themselves<br>
        They aren't gonna change this<br>
        We gotta do it ourselves<br>
        They think that it's over<br>
        But it's just begun<br>
        <br>
        Only one thing can save us<br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        Only the young<br>
        <br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        Only the young<br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        (Don't say you're too tired to fight<br>
        It's just a matter of time<br>
        Up there's the finish line)<br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        Only the young (Only the young)<br>
        Only the young<br>
        Can run<br>
        <br>
        Don't say you're too tired to fight<br>
        It's just a matter of time (Can run)<br>
        Up there's the finish line<br>
        So run, and run, and run<br>
        Don't say you're too tired to fight<br>
        It's just a matter of time (So run)<br>
        Up there's the finish line<br>
        And run, and run, and run<br>
        <br>
        Only the young<br>
        Only the young<br>
        Only the young<br>

        <br>
        "the 1"<br>
        <br>
        I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit<br>
        Been saying "yes" instead of "no"<br>
        I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though<br>
        <br>
        I hit the ground running each night<br>
        I hit the Sunday matinee<br>
        You know the greatest films of all time were never made<br>
        <br>
        I guess you never know, never know<br>
        And if you wanted me, you really should've showed<br>
        And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow<br>
        And it's alright now<br>
        <br>
        But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
        Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
        And if my wishes came true<br>
        It would've been you<br>
        In my defense, I have none<br>
        For never leaving well enough alone<br>
        But it would've been fun<br>
        If you would've been the one<br>
        <br>
        I have this dream you're doing cool shit<br>
        Having adventures on your own<br>
        You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home<br>
        We never painted by the numbers, baby<br>
        But we were making it count<br>
        You know the greatest loves of all time are over now<br>
        <br>
        I guess you never know, never know<br>
        And it's another day, waking up alone<br>
        <br>
        But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
        Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
        And if my wishes came true<br>
        It would've been you<br>
        In my defense, I have none<br>
        For never leaving well enough alone<br>
        But it would've been fun<br>
        If you would've been the one<br>
        <br>
        Hey, yeah-yeah<br>
        I persist and resist the temptation to ask you<br>
        If one thing had been different<br>
        Would everything be different today?<br>
        <br>
        We were something, don't you think so?<br>
        Rosé flowing with your chosen family<br>
        And it would've been sweet<br>
        If it could've been me<br>
        In my defense, I have none<br>
        For digging up the grave another time<br>
        But it would've been fun<br>
        If you would've been the one<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "cardigan"<br>
        <br>
        Vintage tee, brand new phone<br>
        High heels on cobblestones<br>
        When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
        Sequin smile, black lipstick<br>
        Sensual politics<br>
        When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
        <br>
        But I knew you<br>
        Dancing in your Levi's<br>
        Drunk under a streetlight, I<br>
        I knew you<br>
        Hand under my sweatshirt<br>
        Baby, kiss it better, I<br>
        <br>
        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
        You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
        A friend to all is a friend to none<br>
        Chase two girls, lose the one<br>
        When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
        <br>
        But I knew you<br>
        Playing hide-and-seek and<br>
        Giving me your weekends<br>
        I, I knew you<br>
        Your heartbeat on the High Line<br>
        Once in twenty lifetimes, I<br>
        <br>
        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
        You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
        <br>
        To kiss in cars and downtown bars<br>
        Was all we needed<br>
        You drew stars around my scars<br>
        But now I'm bleeding<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I knew you<br>
        Stepping on the last train<br>
        Marked me like a bloodstain, I<br>
        I knew you<br>
        Tried to change the ending<br>
        Peter losing Wendy<br>
        I, I knew you<br>
        Leaving like a father<br>
        Running like water, I<br>
        And when you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
        <br>
        But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss<br>
        I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs<br>
        The smell of smoke would hang around this long<br>
        'Cause I knew everything when I was young<br>
        I knew I'd curse you for the longest time<br>
        Chasing shadows in the grocery line<br>
        I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired<br>
        And you'd be standing in my front porch light<br>
        And I knew you'd come back to me<br>
        You'd come back to me<br>
        And you'd come back to me<br>
        And you'd come back<br>
        <br>
        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
        You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
        <br>

        "the last great american dynasty"<br>
        <br>
        Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny<br>
        Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis<br>
        Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money<br>
        And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"<br>
        <br>
        The wedding was charming, if a little gauche<br>
        There's only so far new money goes<br>
        They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"<br>
        Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud<br>
        The doctor had told him to settle down<br>
        It must have been her fault his heart gave out<br>
        <br>
        And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
        Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been<br>
        There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen<br>
        She had a marvelous time ruining everything."<br>
        <br>
        Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever<br>
        Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city<br>
        Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names<br>
        And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet<br>
        And losing on card game bets with Dalí<br>
        <br>
        And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
        Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been<br>
        There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen<br>
        She had a marvelous time ruining everything."<br>
        <br>
        They say she was seen on occasion<br>
        Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea<br>
        And in a feud with her neighbor<br>
        She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green<br>
        Fifty years is a long time<br>
        Holiday House sat quietly on that beach<br>
        Free of women with madness<br>
        Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me<br>
        <br>
        Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been<br>
        There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen<br>
        I had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
        I had a marvelous time<br>
        Ruining everything<br>
        A marvelous time<br>
        Ruining everything<br>
        A marvelous time<br>
        I had a marvelous time<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "exile"<br>
        (feat. Bon Iver)<br>
        <br>
        I can see you standin', honey<br>
        With his arms around your body<br>
        Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all<br>
        And it took you five whole minutes<br>
        To pack us up and leave me with it<br>
        Holdin' all this love out here in the hall<br>
        <br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        And I didn't like the ending<br>
        You're not my homeland anymore<br>
        So what am I defendin' now?<br>
        You were my town<br>
        Now I'm in exile seein' you out<br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        <br>
        Hoo, hoo-ooh<br>
        Hoo, hoo-ooh<br>
        Hoo, hoo-ooh<br>
        <br>
        I can see you starin', honey<br>
        Like he's just your understudy<br>
        Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me<br>
        Second, third, and hundredth chances<br>
        Balancin' on breaking branches<br>
        Those eyes add insult to injury<br>
        <br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        And I didn't like the ending<br>
        I'm not your problem anymore<br>
        So who am I offending now?<br>
        You were my crown<br>
        Now I'm in exile seein' you out<br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        So I'm leavin' out the side door<br>
        <br>
        So step right out<br>
        There is no amount<br>
        Of cryin' I can do for you<br>
        <br>
        All this time<br>
        We always walked a very thin line<br>
        You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)<br>
        You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
        <br>
        All this time<br>
        I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)<br>
        I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)<br>
        'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
        So many signs<br>
        So many signs (You didn't even see the signs)<br>
        <br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        And I didn't like the ending<br>
        You're not my homeland anymore<br>
        So what am I defending now?<br>
        You were my town<br>
        Now I'm in exile seein' you out<br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        So I'm leaving out the side door<br>
        <br>
        So step right out<br>
        There is no amount<br>

        I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)<br>
        I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)<br>
        'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
        You never gave a warning sign (All this time)<br>
        (So many times) I never learned to read your mind<br>
        (So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)<br>
        'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)<br>
        You never gave a warning sign<br>
        Ah, ah<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "my tears ricochet"<br>
        <br>
        We gather here<br>
        We line up weeping in a sunlit room<br>
        And if I'm on fire<br>
        You'll be made of ashes, too<br>
        <br>
        Even on my worst day<br>
        Did I deserve, babe<br>
        All the hell you gave me?<br>
        'Cause I loved you<br>
        I swear I loved you<br>
        'Til my dying day<br>
        <br>
        I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
        And you're the hero flying around saving face<br>
        And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?<br>
        Cursing my name<br>
        Wishing I stayed<br>
        Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
        <br>
        We gather stones<br>
        Never knowing what they'll mean<br>
        Some to throw<br>
        Some to make a diamond ring<br>
        You know I didn't want to<br>
        Have to haunt you<br>
        But what a ghostly scene<br>
        You wear the same jewels<br>
        That I gave you<br>
        As you bury me<br>
        <br>
        I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
        'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave<br>
        And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?<br>
        Cursing my name<br>
        Wishing I stayed<br>
        Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
        <br>
        And I can go anywhere I want<br>
        Anywhere I want<br>
        Just not home<br>
        And you can aim for my heart, go for blood<br>
        But you would still miss me in your bones<br>
        And I still talk to you<br>
        When I'm screaming at the sky<br>
        And when you can't sleep at night<br>
        You hear my stolen lullabies<br>
        <br>
        I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
        And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves<br>
        You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same<br>
        Cursing my name<br>
        Wishing I stayed<br>
        You turned into your worst fears<br>
        And you're tossing out blame<br>
        Drunk on this pain<br>
        Crossing out the good years<br>
        And you're cursing my name<br>
        Wishing I stayed<br>
        Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
        <br>

        I want you to know<br>
        I'm a mirrorball<br>
        I'll show you every version of yourself tonight<br>
        I'll get you out on the floor<br>
        Shimmering beautiful<br>
        And when I break it's in a million pieces<br>
        <br>
        Hush<br>
        When no one is around, my dear<br>
        You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes<br>
        Spinning in my highest heels, love<br>
        Shining just for you<br>
        Hush<br>
        I know they said the end is near<br>
        But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes<br>
        Spinning in my highest heels, love<br>
        Shining just for you<br>
        <br>
        I want you to know<br>
        I'm a mirrorball<br>
        I can change everything about me to fit in<br>
        You are not like the regulars<br>
        The masquerade revelers<br>
        Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten<br>
        <br>
        Hush<br>
        When no one is around, my dear<br>
        You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes<br>
        Spinning in my highest heels, love<br>
        Shining just for you<br>
        Hush<br>
        I know they said the end is near<br>
        But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes<br>
        Spinning in my highest heels, love<br>
        Shining just for you<br>
        <br>
        And they called off the circus<br>
        Burned the disco down<br>
        When they sent home the horses<br>
        And the rodeo clowns<br>
        I'm still on that tightrope<br>
        I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me<br>
        I'm still a believer but I don't know why<br>
        I've never been a natural<br>
        All I do is try, try, try<br>
        I'm still on that trapeze<br>
        I'm still trying everything<br>
        To keep you looking at me<br>
        <br>
        Because I'm a mirrorball<br>
        I'm a mirrorball<br>
        I'll show you every version of yourself<br>
        Tonight<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "seven"<br>
        <br>
        Please picture me<br>
        In the trees<br>
        I hit my peak at seven<br>
        Feet<br>
        In the swing<br>
        Over the creek<br>
        I was too scared to jump in, but I, I was high<br>
        In the sky<br>
        With Pennsylvania under me<br>
        Are there still beautiful things?<br>
        <br>
        Sweet tea in the summer<br>
        Cross your heart, won't tell no other<br>
        And though I can't recall your face<br>
        I still got love for you<br>
        Your braids like a pattern<br>
        Love you to the moon and to Saturn<br>
        Passed down like folk songs<br>
        The love lasts so long<br>
        <br>
        And I've been meaning to tell you<br>
        I think your house is haunted<br>
        Your dad is always mad and that must be why<br>
        And I think you should come live with<br>
        Me and we can be pirates<br>
        Then you won't have to cry<br>
        Or hide in the closet<br>
        And just like a folk song<br>
        Our love will be passed on<br>
        <br>
        Please picture me<br>
        In the weeds<br>
        Before I learned civility<br>
        I used to scream<br>
        Ferociously<br>
        Any time I wanted<br>
        I, I<br>
        <br>
        Sweet tea in the summer<br>
        Cross my heart, won't tell no other<br>
        And though I can't recall your face<br>
        I still got love for you<br>
        Pack your dolls and a sweater<br>
        We'll move to India forever<br>
        Passed down like folk songs<br>
        Our love lasts so long<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "august"<br>
        <br>
        Salt air<br>
        And the rust on your door<br>
        I never needed anything more<br>
        Whispers<br>
        Of "Are you sure?"<br>
        "Never have I ever before"<br>
        <br>
        But I can see us<br>
        Lost in the memory<br>
        August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
        'Cause it was never mine<br>
        And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
        August sipped away<br>
        Like a bottle of wine<br>
        'Cause you were never mine<br>
        <br>
        Your back<br>
        Beneath the sun<br>
        Wishing I could write my name on it<br>
        Will you call when you're back at school?<br>
        I remember thinking I had you<br>
        <br>
        But I can see us<br>
        Lost in the memory<br>
        August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
        'Cause it was never mine<br>
        And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
        August sipped away<br>
        Like a bottle of wine<br>
        'Cause you were never mine<br>
        <br>
        Back when we were still changing for the better<br>
        Wanting was enough<br>
        For me, it was enough<br>
        To live for the hope of it all<br>
        Cancel plans just in case you'd call<br>
        And say "Meet me behind the mall"<br>
        So much for summer love, and saying "Us"<br>
        'Cause you weren't mine to lose<br>
        You weren't mine to lose<br>
        No<br>
        <br>
        But I can see us<br>
        Lost in the memory<br>
        August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
        'Cause it was never mine<br>
        And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
        August sipped away<br>
        Like a bottle of wine<br>
        'Cause you were never mine, mine<br>
        <br>
        'Cause you were never mine<br>
        Never mine<br>
        But do you remember?<br>
        Remember when I pulled up<br>
        And said "Get in the car"<br>
        And then canceled my plans<br>
        Just in case you'd call?<br>
        Back when I was living for the hope of it all<br>
        For the hope of it all<br>
        "Meet me behind the mall"<br>
        <br>
        (Remember when I pulled up)<br>
        (And said "Get in the car")<br>
        (And then canceled my plans)<br>
        (Just in case you'd call?)<br>
        (Back when I was living for the hope of it all)<br>
        (For the hope of it all)<br>
        ("Meet me behind the mall")<br>
        <br>
        Remember when I pulled up<br>
        And said "Get in the car"<br>
        And then canceled my plans<br>
        Just in case you'd call?<br>
        Back when I was living for the hope of it all<br>
        (For the hope of it all)<br>
        For the hope of it all<br>
        For the hope of it all<br>
        For the hope of it all<br>
        For the hope of it all<br>

        "this is me trying"<br>
        <br>
        I've been having a hard time adjusting<br>
        I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting<br>
        I didn't know if you'd care if I came back<br>
        I have a lot of regrets about that<br>
        Pulled the car off the road to the lookout<br>
        Could've followed my fears all the way down<br>
        And maybe I don't quite know what to say<br>
        But I'm here in your doorway<br>
        <br>
        I just wanted you to know<br>
        That this is me trying<br>
        I just wanted you to know<br>
        That this is me trying<br>
        <br>
        They told me all of my cages were mental<br>
        So I got wasted like all my potential<br>
        And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad<br>
        I have a lot of regrets about that<br>
        I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere<br>
        Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here<br>
        Pourin' out my heart to a stranger<br>
        But I didn't pour the whiskey<br>
        <br>
        I just wanted you to know<br>
        That this is me trying<br>
        I just wanted you to know<br>
        That this is me trying<br>
        <br>
        At least I'm trying<br>
        <br>
        And it's hard to be at a party<br>
        When I feel like an open wound<br>
        It's hard to be anywhere these days<br>
        When all I want is you<br>
        You're a flashback in a film reel<br>
        On the one screen in my town<br>
        <br>
        And I just wanted you to know<br>
        That this is me trying (And maybe I don't quite know what to say)<br>
        I just wanted you to know<br>
        That this is me trying<br>
        <br>
        At least I'm trying<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "illicit affairs"<br>
        <br>
        Make sure nobody sees you leave<br>
        Hood over your head<br>
        Keep your eyes down<br>
        Tell your friends you're out for a run<br>
        You'll be flushed when you return<br>
        Take the road less traveled by<br>
        Tell yourself you can always stop<br>
        What started in beautiful rooms<br>
        Ends with meetings in parking lots<br>
        <br>
        And that's the thing about illicit affairs<br>
        And clandestine meetings<br>
        And longing stares<br>
        It's born from just one single glance<br>
        But it dies and it dies and it dies<br>
        ...a million little times<br>
        <br>
        Leave the perfume on the shelf<br>
        That you picked out just for him<br>
        So you leave no trace behind<br>
        Like you don't even exist<br>
        Take the words for what they are<br>
        A dwindling, mercurial high<br>
        A drug that only worked<br>
        The first few hundred times<br>
        <br>
        And that's the thing about illicit affairs<br>
        And clandestine meetings<br>
        And stolen stares<br>
        They show their truth one single time<br>
        But they lie and they lie and they lie<br>
        ...a million little times<br>
        <br>
        And you wanna scream<br>
        Don't call me "kid"<br>
        Don't call me "baby"<br>
        Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me<br>
        You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else<br>
        Don't call me "kid"<br>
        Don't call me "baby"<br>
        Look at this idiotic fool that you made me<br>
        You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else<br>
        And you know damn well<br>
        For you I would ruin myself<br>
        ...a million little times<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "invisible string"<br>
        <br>
        Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park<br>
        I used to think I would meet somebody there<br>
        Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop<br>
        You used to work at to make a little money<br>
        <br>
        Time<br>
        Curious time<br>
        Gave me no compasses<br>
        Gave me no signs<br>
        Were there clues I didn't see?<br>
        And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
        All along there was some<br>
        Invisible string<br>
        Tying you to me?<br>
        <br>
        Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA<br>
        You ate at my favorite spot for dinner<br>
        Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes<br>
        She said I looked like an American singer<br>
        <br>
        Time<br>
        Mystical time<br>
        Cutting me open, then healing me fine<br>
        Were there clues I didn't see?<br>
        And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
        All along there was some<br>
        Invisible string<br>
        Tying you to me?<br>
        <br>
        A string that pulled me<br>
        Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar<br>
        Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire<br>
        Chains around my demons<br>
        Wool to brave the seasons<br>
        One single thread of gold tied me to you<br>
        <br>
        Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart<br>
        Now I send their babies presents<br>
        Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park<br>
        Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven<br>
        <br>
        Time<br>
        Wondrous time<br>
        Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies<br>
        And it's cool<br>
        Baby with me<br>
        And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
        All along there was some<br>
        Invisible string<br>
        Tying you to me?<br>
        <br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
        Me<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
        <br>
        (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
        (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "mad woman" <br>
        <br>
        What did you think I'd say to that?<br>
        Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?<br>
        They strike to kill and you know I will<br>
        You know I will<br>
        <br>
        What do you sing on your drive home?<br>
        Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?<br>
        Does she smile?<br>
        Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?<br>
        <br>
        Every time you call me crazy<br>
        I get more crazy<br>
        What about that?<br>
        And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry<br>
        And there's nothing like a mad woman<br>
        What a shame she went mad<br>
        No one likes a mad woman<br>
        You made her like that<br>
        And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out<br>
        And you find something to wrap your noose around<br>
        And there's nothing like a mad woman<br>
        <br>
        Now I breathe flames each time I talk<br>
        My cannons all firing at your yacht<br>
        They say "move on"<br>
        But you know I won't<br>
        And women like hunting witches, too<br>
        Doing your dirtiest work for you<br>
        It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together<br>
        <br>
        Every time you call me crazy<br>
        I get more crazy<br>
        What about that?<br>
        And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry<br>
        And there's nothing like a mad woman<br>
        What a shame she went mad<br>
        No one likes a mad woman<br>
        You made her like that<br>
        And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out<br>
        And you find something to wrap your noose around<br>
        And there's nothing like a mad woman<br>
        <br>
        I'm taking my time<br>
        Taking my time<br>
        'Cause you took everything from me<br>
        Watching you climb<br>
        Watching you climb<br>
        Over people like me<br>
        The master of spin<br>
        Has a couple side flings<br>
        Good wives always know<br>
        She should be mad<br>
        Should be scathing like me<br>
        But no one likes a mad woman<br>
        What a shame she went mad<br>
        <br>
        You made her like that<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "epiphany"<br>
        <br>
        Keep your helmet<br>
        Keep your life, son<br>
        Just a flesh wound<br>
        Here's your rifle<br>
        <br>
        Crawling up the beaches now<br>
        "Sir, I think he's bleeding out"<br>
        And some things you just can't speak about<br>
        <br>
        With you, I serve<br>
        With you, I fall down<br>
        Down<br>
        Watch you breathe in<br>
        Watch you breathin' out<br>
        Out<br>
        <br>
        Something med school<br>
        Did not cover<br>
        Someone's daughter<br>
        Someone's mother<br>
        <br>
        Holds your hand through plastic now<br>
        "Doc, I think she's crashing out"<br>
        And some things you just can't speak about<br>
        <br>
        Only twenty minutes to sleep<br>
        But you dream of some epiphany<br>
        Just one single glimpse of relief<br>
        To make some sense of what you've seen<br>
        <br>
        With you, I serve<br>
        With you, I fall down<br>
        Down (Down)<br>
        Watch you breathe in<br>
        Watch you breathin' out<br>
        Out<br>
        <br>
        With you, I serve<br>
        With you, I serve<br>
        With you, I fall down (Down)<br>
        Down (Down)<br>
        Watch you breathe in<br>
        Watch you breathe in<br>
        Watch you breathin' out (Out)<br>
        Out (Out)<br>
        <br>
        Only twenty minutes to sleep<br>
        But you dream of some epiphany<br>
        Just one single glimpse of relief<br>
        To make some sense of what you've seen<br>

        <br>
        "betty"<br>
        <br>
        Betty, I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom<br>
        But I think it's 'cause of me<br>
        Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house<br>
        It's like I couldn't breathe<br>
        You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
        You can't believe a word she says<br>
        Most times, but this time it was true<br>
        The worst thing that I ever did<br>
        Was what I did to you<br>
        <br>
        But if I just showed up at your party<br>
        Would you have me?<br>
        Would you want me?<br>
        Would you tell me to go fuck myself<br>
        Or lead me to the garden?<br>
        In the garden would you trust me<br>
        If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br>
        I'm only seventeen<br>
        I don't know anything but I know I miss you<br>
        <br>
        Betty, I know where it all went wrong<br>
        Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym<br>
        I was nowhere to be found, I hate the crowds, you know that<br>
        Plus, I saw you dance with him<br>
        You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
        You can't believe a word she says<br>
        Most times, but this time it was true<br>
        The worst thing that I ever did<br>
        Was what I did to you<br>
        <br>
        But if I just showed up at your party<br>
        Would you have me?<br>
        Would you want me?<br>
        Would you tell me to go fuck myself<br>
        Or lead me to the garden?<br>
        In the garden would you trust me<br>
        If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br>
        I'm only seventeen<br>
        I don't know anything but I know I miss you<br>
        <br>
        I was walking home on broken cobblestones<br>
        Just thinking of you when she pulled up<br>
        Like a figment of my worst intentions<br>
        She said "James, get in, let's drive"<br>
        Those days turned into nights<br>
        Slept next to her but<br>
        I dreamt of you all summer long<br>
        <br>
        Betty, I'm here on your doorstep<br>
        And I planned it out for weeks now but, it's finally sinking in<br>
        Betty, right now is the last time<br>
        I can dream about what happens when you see my face again<br>
        The only thing I wanna do<br>
        Is make it up to you<br>
        <br>
        So, I showed up at your party<br>
        Yeah, I showed up at your party<br>
        Yeah, I showed up at your party<br>
        Will you have me?<br>
        Will you love me?<br>
        Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?<br>
        If you kiss me<br>
        Will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings?<br>
        I'm only seventeen<br>
        I don't know anything<br>
        But I know I miss you<br>
        Standing in your cardigan<br>
        Kissing in my car again<br>
        Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "peace"<br>
        <br>
        Our coming-of-age has come and gone<br>
        Suddenly this summer it's clear<br>
        I never had the courage of my convictions<br>
        As long as danger is near<br>
        And it's just around the corner, darlin'<br>
        'Cause it lives in me<br>
        No, I could never give you peace<br>
        <br>
        But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm<br>
        If your cascade ocean wave blues come<br>
        All these people think love's for show<br>
        But I would die for you in secret<br>
        The devil's in the details<br>
        But you got a friend in me<br>
        Would it be enough<br>
        If I could never give you peace?<br>
        <br>
        Your integrity makes me seem small<br>
        You paint dreamscapes on the wall<br>
        I talk shit with my friends<br>
        It's like I'm wastin' your honor<br>
        <br>
        And you know that I'd<br>
        Swing with you for the fences<br>
        Sit with you in the trenches<br>
        Give you my wild, give you a child<br>
        Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other<br>
        Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother<br>
        Is it enough?<br>
        But there's robbers to the east<br>
        Clowns to the West<br>
        I'd give you my sunshine<br>
        Give you my best<br>
        But the rain is always gonna come<br>
        If you're standing with me<br>
        <br>
        But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm<br>
        If your cascade ocean wave blues come<br>
        All these people think love's for show<br>
        But I would die for you in secret<br>
        The devil's in the details<br>
        But you got a friend in me<br>
        Would it be enough<br>
        If I could never give you peace?<br>
        Would it be enough<br>
        If I could never give you peace?<br>
        Would it be enough<br>
        If I could never give you peace?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "hoax"<br>
        <br>
        My only one<br>
        My smoking gun<br>
        My eclipsed sun<br>
        This has broken me down<br>
        My twisted knife<br>
        My sleepless night<br>
        My winless fight<br>
        This has frozen my ground<br>
        <br>
        Stood on the cliffside<br>
        Screaming, "Give me a reason"<br>
        Your faithless love's the only hoax<br>
        I believe in<br>
        Don't want no other shade of blue<br>
        But you<br>
        No other sadness in the world would do<br>
        <br>
        My best laid plan<br>
        Your sleight of hand<br>
        My barren land<br>
        I am ash from your fire<br>
        <br>
        Stood on the cliffside<br>
        Screaming "Give me a reason"<br>
        Your faithless love's the only hoax<br>
        I believe in<br>
        Don't want no other shade of blue<br>
        But you<br>
        No other sadness in the world would do<br>
        <br>
        You know I left a part of me back in New York<br>
        You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for<br>
        You knew it still hurts underneath my scars<br>
        From when they pulled me apart<br>
        You knew the password, so I let you in the door<br>
        You knew you won, so what's the point of keeping score?<br>
        You knew it still hurts underneath my scars<br>
        From when they pulled me apart<br>
        But what you did was just as dark<br>
        Darling, this was just as hard<br>
        As when they pulled me apart<br>
        <br>
        My only one<br>
        My kingdom come undone<br>
        My broken drum<br>
        You have beaten my heart<br>
        <br>
        Don't want no other shade of blue<br>
        But you<br>
        No other sadness in the world would do<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "the lakes"<br>
        <br>
        Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?<br>
        I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones<br>
        These hunters with cell phones<br>
        <br>
        Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die<br>
        I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you<br>
        Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry<br>
        I'm setting off, but not without my muse<br>
        <br>
        What should be over burrowed under my skin<br>
        In heart-stopping waves of hurt<br>
        I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze<br>
        Tell me what are my words worth<br>
        <br>
        Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die<br>
        I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you<br>
        Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry<br>
        I'm setting off, but not without my muse<br>
        <br>
        I want auroras and sad prose<br>
        I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet<br>
        'Cause I haven't moved in years<br>
        And I want you right here<br>
        A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground<br>
        With no one around to tweet it<br>
        While I bathe in cliffside pools<br>
        With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief<br>
        <br>
        Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die<br>
        I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you<br>
        Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry<br>
        I'm setting off, but not without my muse<br>
        No, not without you<br>

        “evermore” (released December 11, 2020)<br>
        <br>
        "willow"<br>
        <br>
        I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night<br>
        Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife<br>
        And if it was an open/shut case<br>
        I never would've known from that look on your face<br>
        Lost in your current like a priceless wine<br>
        <br>
        The more that you say, the less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        <br>
        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind<br>
        Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in<br>
        As if you were a mythical thing<br>
        Like you were a trophy or a champion ring<br>
        And there was one prize I'd cheat to win<br>
        <br>
        The more that you say, the less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        You know that my train could take you home<br>
        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        <br>
        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind<br>
        They count me out time and time again<br>
        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind<br>
        But I come back stronger than a 90's trend<br>
        <br>
        Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark<br>
        Show me the places where the others gave you scars<br>
        Now this is an open/shut case<br>
        I guess I should've known from the look on your face<br>
        Every bait-and-switch was a work of art<br>
        <br>
        The more that you say, the less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        You know that my train could take you home<br>
        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        <br>
        The more that you say, the less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        You know that my train could take you home<br>
        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        <br>
        Hey, that's my man<br>
        That's my man<br>
        Yeah, that's my man<br>
        Every bait-and-switch was a work of art<br>
        That's my man<br>
        Hey, that's my man<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>

        "champagne problems"<br>
        <br>
        You booked the night train for a reason<br>
        So you could sit there in this hurt<br>
        Bustling crowds or silent sleepers<br>
        You're not sure which is worse<br>
        <br>
        Because I dropped your hand while dancing<br>
        Left you out there standing<br>
        Crestfallen on the landing<br>
        Champagne problems<br>
        Your mom's ring in your pocket<br>
        My picture in your wallet<br>
        Your heart was glass, I dropped it<br>
        Champagne problems<br>
        <br>
        You told your family for a reason<br>
        You couldn't keep it in<br>
        Your sister splashed out on the bottle<br>
        Now no one's celebrating<br>
        <br>
        Dom Pérignon, you brought it<br>
        No crowd of friends applauded<br>
        Your hometown skeptics called it<br>
        Champagne problems<br>
        You had a speech, you're speechless<br>
        Love slipped beyond your reaches<br>
        And I couldn't give a reason<br>
        Champagne problems<br>
        <br>
        Your Midas touch on the Chevy door<br>
        November flush and your flannel cure<br>
        "This dorm was once a madhouse"<br>
        I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"<br>
        How evergreen, our group of friends<br>
        Don't think we'll say that word again<br>
        And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls<br>
        That we once walked through<br>
        One for the money, two for the show<br>
        I never was ready, so I watch you go<br>
        Sometimes you just don't know the answer<br>
        'Til someone's on their knees and asks you<br>
        "She would've made such a lovely bride<br>
        What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said<br>
        But you'll find the real thing instead<br>
        She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred<br>
        <br>
        And hold your hand while dancing<br>
        Never leave you standing<br>
        Crestfallen on the landing<br>
        With champagne problems<br>
        Your mom's ring in your pocket<br>
        Her picture in your wallet<br>
        You won't remember all my<br>
        Champagne problems<br>
        <br>
        You won't remember all my<br>
        Champagne problems<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "gold rush"<br>
        <br>
        Gleaming<br>
        Twinkling<br>
        Eyes like sinking ships<br>
        On waters so inviting<br>
        I almost jump in<br>
        <br>
        I don't like a gold rush, gold rush<br>
        I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush<br>
        I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch<br>
        Everybody wants you<br>
        Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you<br>
        Walk past, quick brush<br>
        I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush<br>
        I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush<br>
        Everybody wants you<br>
        But I don't like a gold rush<br>
        <br>
        What must it be like<br>
        To grow up that beautiful?<br>
        With your hair falling into place like dominoes<br>
        I see me padding across your wooden floors<br>
        With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door<br>
        At dinner parties<br>
        I call you out on your contrarian shit<br>
        And the coastal town<br>
        We wandered 'round had never<br>
        Seen a love as pure as it<br>
        And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea<br>
        'Cause it could never be<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush<br>
        I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush<br>
        I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch<br>
        Everybody wants you<br>
        Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you<br>
        Walk past, quick brush<br>
        I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush<br>
        I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush<br>
        Everybody wants you<br>
        And I don't like a gold rush<br>
        <br>
        What must it be like<br>
        To grow up that beautiful?<br>
        With your hair falling into place like dominoes<br>
        My mind turns your life into folklore<br>
        I can't dare to dream about you anymore<br>
        At dinner parties<br>
        I won't call you out on your contrarian shit<br>
        And the coastal town<br>
        We never found will never<br>
        See a love as pure as it<br>
        'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea<br>
        'Cause it will never be<br>
        Gleaming<br>
        Twinkling<br>
        Eyes like sinking ships<br>
        On waters so inviting<br>
        I almost jump in<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "'tis the damn season"<br>
        <br>
        If I wanted to know<br>
        Who you were hanging with<br>
        While I was gone, I would've asked you<br>
        It's the kind of cold<br>
        Fogs up windshield glass<br>
        But I felt it when I passed you<br>
        There's an ache in you<br>
        Put there by the ache in me<br>
        But if it's all the same to you<br>
        It's the same to me<br>
        <br>
        So we could call it even<br>
        You could call me "babe" for the weekend<br>
        'Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
        I'm staying at my parents' house<br>
        And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
        And it always leads to you and my hometown<br>
        <br>
        I parked my car<br>
        Right between the Methodist and the school that used to be ours<br>
        The holidays linger like bad perfume<br>
        You can run but only so far<br>
        I escaped it too<br>
        Remember how you watched me leave<br>
        But if it's okay with you<br>
        It's okay with me<br>
        <br>
        We could call it even<br>
        You could call me "babe" for the weekend<br>
        'Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
        I'm staying at my parents' house<br>
        And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
        Time flies<br>
        Messy as the mud on your truck tires<br>
        Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out<br>
        We could just ride around<br>
        And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
        And it always leads to you and my hometown<br>
        <br>
        Sleep in half the day<br>
        Just for old times' sake<br>
        I won't ask you to wait<br>
        If you don't ask me to stay<br>
        So I'll go back to LA<br>
        And the so-called friends who'll write books about me if I ever make it<br>
        And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm faking<br>
        And the heart I know I'm breaking is my own<br>
        To leave the warmest bed I've ever known<br>
        <br>
        We could call it even<br>
        Even though I'm leaving<br>
        And I'll be yours for the weekend<br>
        'Tis the damn season<br>
        <br>
        We could call it even<br>
        You could call me "babe" for the weekend<br>
        'Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
        I'm staying at my parents' house<br>
        And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
        Time flies<br>
        Messy as the mud on your truck tires<br>
        Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out<br>
        We could just ride around<br>
        And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
        And it always leads to you and my hometown<br>
        It always leads to you and my hometown<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "tolerate it"<br>
        <br>
        I sit and watch you reading with your head low<br>
        I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed<br>
        I sit and watch you, I notice everything you do or don't do<br>
        You're so much older and wiser and I<br>
        <br>
        I wait by the door like I'm just a kid<br>
        Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
        Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
        And watch you tolerate it<br>
        If it's all in my head tell me now<br>
        Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
        I know my love should be celebrated<br>
        But you tolerate it<br>
        <br>
        I greet you with a battle hero's welcome<br>
        I take your indiscretions all in good fun<br>
        I sit and listen, I polish plates until they gleam and glisten<br>
        You're so much older and wiser and I<br>
        <br>
        I wait by the door like I'm just a kid<br>
        Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
        Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
        And watch you tolerate it<br>
        If it's all in my head tell me now<br>
        Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
        I know my love should be celebrated<br>
        But you tolerate it<br>
        <br>
        While you were out building other worlds, where was I?<br>
        Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?<br>
        I made you my temple, my mural, my sky<br>
        Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life<br>
        Drawing hearts in the byline<br>
        Always taking up too much space or time<br>
        You assume I'm fine<br>
        But what would you do if I<br>
        <br>
        Break free and leave us in ruins<br>
        Took this dagger in me and removed it<br>
        Gain the weight of you then lose it<br>
        Believe me, I could do it<br>
        If it's all in my head tell me now<br>
        Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
        I know my love should be celebrated<br>
        But you tolerate it<br>
        I sit and watch you<br>
        <br>

        "no body, no crime"<br>

        <br>
        He did it<br>
        He did it<br>
        <br>
        Este's a friend of mine<br>
        We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine<br>
        Este's been losing sleep<br>
        Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity<br>
        She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth<br>
        That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"<br>
        No, there ain't no doubt<br>
        I think I'm gonna call him out<br>
        She says<br>
        <br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
        No, no body, no crime<br>
        But I ain't letting up until the day I die<br>
        <br>
        No, no<br>
        I think he did it<br>
        No, no<br>
        He did it<br>
        <br>
        Este wasn't there<br>
        Tuesday night at Olive Garden at her job or anywhere<br>
        He reports his missing wife<br>
        And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires<br>
        And his mistress moved in<br>
        Sleeps in Este's bed and everything<br>
        No, there ain't no doubt<br>
        Somebody's gotta catch him out<br>
        'Cause<br>
        <br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it (He did it)<br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it (He did it)<br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
        No, no body, no crime<br>
        But I ain't letting up until the day I die<br>
        No, no<br>
        I think he did it<br>
        No, no<br>
        He did it<br>
        <br>
        Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was 15<br>
        And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene<br>
        Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")<br>
        Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy<br>
        <br>
        They think she did it but they just can't prove it<br>
        They think she did it but they just can't prove it<br>
        She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it<br>
        <br>
        No, no body, no crime<br>
        I wasn't letting up until the day he<br>
        No, no body, no crime<br>
        I wasn't letting up until the day he<br>
        No, no body, no crime<br>
        I wasn't letting up until the day he<br>

        "happiness"<br>
        <br>
        Honey, when I'm above the trees<br>
        I see this for what it is<br>
        But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given<br>
        Is just shit we're dividin' up<br>
        Showed you all of my hiding spots<br>
        I was dancing when the music stopped<br>
        And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention<br>
        I haven't met the new me yet<br>
        <br>
        There'll be happiness after you<br>
        But there was happiness because of you<br>
        Both of these things can be true<br>
        There is happiness<br>
        <br>
        Past the blood and bruise<br>
        Past the curses and cries<br>
        Beyond the terror in the nightfall<br>
        Haunted by the look in my eyes<br>
        That would've loved you for a lifetime<br>
        Leave it all behind<br>
        And there is happiness<br>
        <br>
        Tell me, when did your winning smile<br>
        Begin to look like a smirk?<br>
        When did all our lessons start to look like weapons<br>
        Pointed at my deepest hurt?<br>
        I hope she'll be a beautiful fool<br>
        Who takes my spot next to you<br>
        No, I didn't mean that<br>
        Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury<br>
        You haven't met the new me yet<br>
        <br>
        There'll be happiness after me<br>
        But there was happiness because of me<br>
        Both of these things, I believe<br>
        There is happiness<br>
        <br>
        In our history, across our great divide<br>
        There is a glorious sunrise<br>
        Dappled with the flickers of light<br>
        From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind<br>
        And there is happiness<br>
        <br>
        I can't make it go away by making you a villain<br>
        I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven<br>
        And I pulled your body into mine<br>
        Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties<br>
        No one teaches you what to do<br>
        When a good man hurts you<br>
        And you know you hurt him, too<br>
        <br>
        Honey, when I'm above the trees<br>
        I see it for what it is<br>
        But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head<br>
        After giving you the best I had<br>
        Tell me what to give after that<br>
        All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness<br>
        You haven't met the new me yet<br>
        And I think she'll give you that<br>
        <br>
        There'll be happiness after you<br>
        But there was happiness because of you, too<br>
        Both of these things can be true<br>
        There is happiness<br>
        <br>
        In our history, across our great divide<br>
        There is a glorious sunrise<br>
        Dappled with the flickers of light<br>
        From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind<br>
        Oh, leave it all behind<br>
        Leave it all behind<br>
        And there is happiness<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "dorothea"<br>
        <br>
        Hey Dorothea<br>
        Do you ever stop and think about me?<br>
        When we were younger<br>
        Down in the park<br>
        Honey, making a lark of the misery<br>
        You got shiny friends since you left town<br>
        A tiny screen's the only place I see you now<br>
        And I got nothing but well wishes for ya<br>
        <br>
        Oooh<br>
        This place is the same as it ever was<br>
        Oooh<br>
        But you won't like it that way<br>
        <br>
        It's never too late<br>
        To come back to my side<br>
        The stars in your eyes<br>
        Shined brighter in Tupelo<br>
        And if you're ever tired of being known<br>
        For who you know<br>
        You know that you'll always know me<br>
        Dorothea<br>
        Dorothea<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, you're a queen<br>
        Selling dreams<br>
        Selling make-up and magazines<br>
        Ooh, from you I'd buy anything<br>
        <br>
        Hey Dorothea<br>
        Do you ever stop and think about me?<br>
        When it was calmer<br>
        Skipping the prom<br>
        Just to piss off your mom<br>
        And her pageant schemes<br>
        And damn, Dorothea<br>
        They all wanna be ya<br>
        But are you still the same soul<br>
        I met under the bleachers? Well<br>
        <br>
        Oooh<br>
        I guess I'll never know<br>
        Oooh<br>
        And you'll go on with the show<br>
        <br>
        But it's never too late<br>
        To come back to my side<br>
        The stars in your eyes<br>
        Shined brighter in Tupelo<br>
        And if you're ever tired of being known<br>
        For who you know<br>
        You know you'll always know me<br>
        <br>
        Dorothea<br>
        Dorothea<br>
        <br>
        Oooh<br>
        Oooh<br>
        Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
        Oooh<br>
        Oooh<br>
        Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>

        "coney island"<br>
        (feat. The National)<br>
        <br>
        Break my soul in two<br>
        Looking for you but you're right here<br>
        If I can't relate to you anymore<br>
        Then who am I related to?<br>
        And if this is the long haul<br>
        How'd we get here so soon?<br>
        Did I close my fist around something delicate?<br>
        Did I shatter you?<br>
        <br>
        And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?<br>
        The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go<br>
        Sorry for not making you my centerfold<br>
        <br>
        Over and over<br>
        Lost again with no surprises<br>
        Disappointments, close your eyes<br>
        And it gets colder and colder<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        <br>
        The question pounds my head<br>
        "What's a lifetime of achievement?"<br>
        If I pushed you to the edge<br>
        But you were too polite to leave me<br>
        And do you miss the rogue<br>
        Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?<br>
        Will you forgive my soul<br>
        When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?<br>
        'Cause we were like the mall before the Internet<br>
        It was the one place to be<br>
        The mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams<br>
        Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring<br>
        <br>
        Over and over<br>
        Lost again with no surprises<br>
        Disappointments, close your eyes<br>
        And it gets colder and colder<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        <br>
        Were you waiting at our old spot<br>
        In the tree line by the gold clock<br>
        Did I leave you hanging every single day?<br>
        Were you standing in the hallway<br>
        With a big cake, happy birthday<br>
        Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray?<br>
        A universe away<br>
        And when I got into the accident<br>
        The sight that flashed before me was your face<br>
        But when I walked up to the podium<br>
        I think that I forgot to say your name<br>
        <br>
        I'm on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?<br>
        The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go<br>
        Sorry for not making you my centerfold<br>
        Over and over<br>
        <br>
        Lost again with no surprises<br>
        Disappointments, close your eyes<br>
        And it gets colder and colder<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        <br>
        The sight that flashed before me was your face<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        But I think that I forgot to say your name<br>
        Over and over<br>
        Sorry for not making you my<br>
        Making you my<br>
        Making you my centerfold<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "ivy"<br>
        <br>
        How's one to know?<br>
        I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones<br>
        In a faith-forgotten land<br>
        In from the snow<br>
        Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow<br>
        Tarnished but so grand<br>
        <br>
        And the old widow goes to the stone every day<br>
        But I don't, I just sit here and wait<br>
        Grieving for the living<br>
        <br>
        Oh, goddamn<br>
        My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand<br>
        Taking mine, but it's been promised to another<br>
        Oh, I can't<br>
        Stop you putting roots in my dreamland<br>
        My house of stone, your ivy grows<br>
        And now I'm covered in you<br>
        <br>
        I wish to know<br>
        The fatal flaw that makes you long to be<br>
        Magnificently cursed<br>
        He's in the room<br>
        Your opal eyes are all I wish to see<br>
        He wants what's only yours<br>
        <br>
        Oh, goddamn<br>
        My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand<br>
        Taking mine, but it's been promised to another<br>
        Oh, I can't<br>
        Stop you putting roots in my dreamland<br>
        My house of stone, your ivy grows<br>
        And now I'm covered<br>
        <br>
        Clover blooms in the fields<br>
        Spring breaks loose, the time is near<br>
        What would he do if he found us out?<br>
        Crescent moon, coast is clear<br>
        Spring breaks loose, but so does fear<br>
        He's gonna burn this house to the ground<br>
        <br>
        How's one to know?<br>
        I'd live and die for moments that we stole<br>
        On begged and borrowed time<br>
        So tell me to run<br>
        Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become<br>
        And drink my husband's wine<br>
        <br>
        Oh, goddamn<br>
        My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand<br>
        Taking mine, but it's been promised to another<br>
        Oh, I can't<br>
        Stop you putting roots in my dreamland<br>
        My house of stone, your ivy grows<br>
        And now I'm covered in you<br>
        And I'm covered in you<br>
        <br>
        So yeah, it's a fire<br>
        It's a goddamn blaze in the dark<br>
        And you started it<br>
        You started it<br>
        So yeah, it's a war<br>
        It's the goddamn fight of my life<br>
        And you started it<br>
        You started it<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I can't<br>
        Stop you putting roots in my dreamland<br>
        My house of stone, your ivy grows<br>
        And now I'm covered<br>
        In you<br>
        In you<br>
        Now I'm covered in you<br>
        In you<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "cowboy like me"<br>
        <br>
        And the tennis court was covered up<br>
        With some tent-like thing<br>
        And you asked me to dance<br>
        But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game."<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I thought<br>
        This is gonna be one of those things<br>
        Now I know<br>
        I'm never gonna love again<br>
        <br>
        I've got some tricks up my sleeve<br>
        Takes one to know one<br>
        You're a cowboy like me<br>
        <br>
        Never wanted love<br>
        Just a fancy car<br>
        Now I'm waiting by the phone<br>
        Like I'm sitting in an airport bar<br>
        <br>
        You had some tricks up your sleeve<br>
        Takes one to know one<br>
        You're a cowboy like me<br>
        <br>
        Perched in the dark<br>
        Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear<br>
        Like it could be love<br>
        I could be the way forward<br>
        Only if they pay for it<br>
        You're a bandit like me<br>
        Eyes full of stars<br>
        Hustling for the good life<br>
        Never thought I'd meet you here<br>
        It could be love<br>
        We could be the way forward<br>
        And I know I'll pay for it<br>
        <br>
        You're a cowboy like me<br>
        <br>
        Perched in the dark<br>
        Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear<br>

        I could be the way forward<br>

        We could be the way forward<br>
        And I know I'll pay for it<br>
        <br>
        And the skeletons in both our closets<br>
        Plotted hard to fuck this up<br>
        And the old men that I've swindled<br>
        Really did believe I was the one<br>
        And the ladies lunching have their stories about<br>
        When you passed through town<br>
        But that was all before I locked it down<br>
        <br>
        Now you hang from my lips<br>
        Like the Gardens of Babylon<br>
        With your boots beneath my bed<br>
        Forever is the sweetest con<br>
        <br>
        I've had some tricks up my sleeve<br>
        Takes one to know one<br>
        You're a cowboy like me<br>
        And I'm never gonna love again<br>
        I'm never gonna love again<br>
        I'm never gonna love again<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "long story short"<br>
        <br>
        Fatefully<br>
        I tried to pick my battles<br>
        'Til the battle picked me<br>
        Misery<br>
        Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep<br>
        And you passed right by<br>
        I was in the alley surrounded on all sides<br>
        The knife cuts both ways<br>
        If the shoe fits, walk in it<br>
        'Til your high heels break<br>
        <br>
        And I fell from the pedestal<br>
        Right down the rabbit hole<br>
        Long story short, it was a bad time<br>
        Pushed from the precipice<br>
        Clung to the nearest lips<br>
        Long story short, it was the wrong guy<br>
        Now I'm all about you<br>
        I'm all about you<br>
        I'm all about you<br>
        <br>
        Actually<br>
        I always felt I must look better in the rear view<br>
        Missing me<br>
        At the golden gates they once held the keys to<br>
        When I dropped my sword<br>
        I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door<br>
        And we live in peace<br>
        But if someone comes at us<br>
        This time I'm ready<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I fell from the pedestal<br>
        Right down the rabbit hole<br>
        Long story short, it was a bad time<br>
        Pushed from the precipice<br>
        Clung to the nearest lips<br>
        Long story short, it was the wrong guy<br>
        Now I'm all about you<br>
        I'm all about you<br>
        I'm all about you<br>
        <br>
        No more keepin' score<br>
        Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)<br>
        No more tug of war<br>
        Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)<br>
        No more keepin' score<br>
        Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)<br>
        And my waves meet your shore<br>
        Ever and evermore<br>
        <br>
        Past me<br>
        I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things<br>
        Your nemeses will defeat themselves<br>
        Before you get the chance to swing<br>
        And he's passing by<br>
        Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky<br>
        And he feels like home<br>
        If the shoe fits, walk in it<br>
        Everywhere you go<br>
        <br>
        And I fell from the pedestal<br>
        Right down the rabbit hole<br>
        Long story short, it was a bad time<br>
        Pushed from the precipice<br>
        Climbed right back up the cliff<br>
        Long story short, I survived<br>
        Now I'm all about you<br>
        (And now) I'm all about you, ah<br>
        (And now) I'm all about you<br>
        (And now) I'm all about you, ah<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>
        I'm all about you<br>
        (And now) Yeah, yeah<br>
        I'm all about you<br>
        <br>
        Long story short, it was a bad time<br>

        "marjorie"<br>
        <br>
        Never be so kind, you forget to be clever<br>
        Never be so clever, you forget to be kind<br>
        <br>
        And if I didn't know better<br>
        I'd think you were talking to me now<br>
        If I didn't know better<br>
        I'd think you were still around<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        You're alive, you're alive in my head<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        You're alive, so alive<br>
        <br>
        Never be so polite, you forget your power<br>
        Never wield such power, you forget to be polite<br>
        <br>
        And if I didn't know better<br>
        I'd think you were listening to me now<br>
        If I didn't know better<br>
        I'd think you were still around<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        You're alive, you're alive in my head<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        You're alive, so alive<br>
        <br>
        The autumn chill that wakes me up<br>
        You loved the amber skies so much<br>
        Long limbs and frozen swims<br>
        You'd always go past where our feet could touch<br>
        And I complained the whole way there<br>
        The car ride back and up the stairs<br>
        I should've asked you questions<br>
        I should've asked you how to be<br>
        Asked you to write it down for me<br>
        Should've kept every grocery store receipt<br>
        'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me<br>
        Watched as you signed your name Marjorie<br>
        All your closets of backlogged dreams<br>
        And how you left them all to me<br>
        <br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        You're alive, you're alive in my head<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        What died didn't stay dead<br>
        You're alive, so alive<br>
        And if I didn't know better<br>
        I'd think you were singing to me now<br>
        If I didn't know better<br>
        I'd think you were still around<br>
        I know better<br>
        But I still feel you all around<br>
        I know better<br>
        But you're still around<br>
        <br>

        "closure"<br>
        <br>
        It's been a long time<br>
        And seeing the shape of your name<br>
        Still spells out pain<br>
        It wasn't right<br>
        The way it all went down<br>
        Looks like you know that now<br>
        <br>
        Yes, I got your letter<br>
        Yes, I'm doing better<br>
        It cut deep to know ya<br>
        Right to the bone<br>
        Yes, I got your letter<br>
        Yes, I'm doing better<br>
        I know that it's over<br>
        I don't need your "closure"<br>
        Your "closure"<br>
        <br>
        Don't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled<br>
        I'm fine with my spite<br>
        And my tears<br>
        And my beers and my candles<br>
        I can feel you smoothing me over<br>
        <br>
        Yes, I got your letter<br>
        Yes, I'm doing better<br>
        It cut deep to know ya<br>
        Right to the bone<br>
        Yes, I got your letter<br>
        Yes, I'm doing better<br>
        I know that it's over<br>
        I don't need your "closure"<br>
        Your "closure"<br>
        Your "closure"<br>
        Your "closure"<br>
        <br>
        I know I'm just a<br>
        Wrinkle in your new life<br>
        Staying "friends"<br>
        Would iron it out so nice<br>
        Guilty, guilty reaching out across the sea<br>
        That you put between you and me<br>
        But it's fake<br>
        And it's oh so unnecessary<br>
        <br>
        Yes, I got your letter<br>
        Yes, I'm doing better<br>
        It cut deep to know ya<br>
        Right to the bone<br>
        Yes, I got your letter<br>
        Yes, I'm doing better<br>
        I know that it's over<br>
        I don't need your "closure"<br>
        "Closure"<br>
        Your "closure"<br>
        Your "closure"<br>

        "evermore"<br>
        (feat. Bon Iver)<br>
        <br>
        Gray November<br>
        I've been down since July<br>
        Motion capture<br>
        Put me in a bad light<br>
        <br>
        I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone<br>
        Trying to find the one where I went wrong<br>
        Writing letters<br>
        Addressed to the fire<br>
        <br>
        And I was catching my breath<br>
        Staring out an open window<br>
        Catching my death<br>
        And I couldn't be sure<br>
        I had a feeling so peculiar<br>
        That this pain would be for<br>
        Evermore<br>
        <br>
        Hey December<br>
        Guess I'm feeling unmoored<br>
        Can't remember<br>
        What I used to fight for<br>
        <br>
        I rewind the tape but all it does is pause<br>
        On the very moment all was lost<br>
        Sending signals<br>
        To be double-crossed<br>
        <br>
        And I was catching my breath<br>
        Barefoot in the wildest winter<br>
        Catching my death<br>
        And I couldn't be sure<br>
        I had a feeling so peculiar<br>
        That this pain would be for<br>
        Evermore<br>
        (Evermore)<br>
        <br>
        Can't not think of all the cost<br>
        And the things that will be lost<br>
        Oh, can we just get a pause?<br>
        To be certain we'll be tall again<br>
        Whether weather be the frost<br>
        Or the violence of the dog days<br>
        I'm on waves, out being tossed<br>
        Is there a line that I could just go cross?<br>
        <br>
        And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)<br>
        I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)<br>
        In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)<br>
        I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)<br>
        (If you think of all the costs)<br>
        It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)<br>
        To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)<br>
        (Or the violence of the dog days)<br>
        (Out on waves, being tossed)<br>
        (I'm on waves, out being tossed)<br>
        I swear (Is there a line that we could just go cross?)<br>
        You were there<br>
        <br>
        And I was catching my breath<br>
        Floors of a cabin creaking under my step<br>
        And I couldn't be sure<br>
        I had a feeling so peculiar<br>
        This pain wouldn't be for<br>
        Evermore<br>
        Evermore<br>
        Evermore<br>
        This pain wouldn't be for evermore<br>
        Evermore<br>

        "right where you left me"<br>
        <br>
        Friends break up, friends get married<br>
        Strangers get born, strangers get buried<br>
        Trends change, rumors fly through new skies<br>
        But I'm right where you left me<br>
        Matches burn after the other<br>
        Pages turn and stick to each other<br>
        Wages earned and lessons learned<br>
        But I'm right where you left me<br>
        <br>
        Help, I'm still at the restaurant<br>
        Still sitting in a corner I haunt<br>
        Cross-legged in the dim light<br>
        They say, "What a sad sight," I<br>
        I swear you could hear a hair pin drop<br>
        Right when I felt the moment stop<br>
        Glass shattered on the white cloth<br>
        Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there<br>
        Dust collected on my pinned-up hair<br>
        They expected me to find somewhere<br>
        Some perspective, but I sat and stared<br>
        Right where you left me<br>
        <br>
        You left me no, you left me no<br>
        You left me no choice but to stay here forever<br>
        You left me, you left me no, you left me no<br>
        You left me no choice but to stay here forever<br>
        <br>
        Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?<br>
        Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it<br>
        She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy<br>
        How it was supposed to be<br>
        Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?<br>
        Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it<br>
        She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy<br>
        And you're sitting in front of me<br>
        <br>
        At the restaurant when I was still the one you want<br>
        Cross-legged in the dim light<br>
        Everything was just right, I<br>
        I could feel the mascara run<br>
        You told me that you met someone<br>
        Glass shattered on the white cloth<br>
        Everybody moved on<br>
        <br>
        Help, I'm still at the restaurant<br>
        Still sitting in a corner I haunt<br>
        Cross-legged in the dim light<br>
        They say, "What a sad sight," I<br>
        I stayed there<br>
        Dust collected on my pinned-up hair<br>
        I'm sure that you got a wife out there<br>
        Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware<br>
        'Cause I'm right where<br>
        I cause no harm<br>
        Mind my business<br>
        If our love died young<br>
        I can't bear witness<br>
        And it's been so long<br>
        But if you ever think you got it wrong<br>
        <br>
        I'm right where<br>
        You left me<br>
        You left me no, you left me no<br>
        You left me no choice but to stay here forever<br>
        You left me<br>
        You left me no, you left me no<br>
        You left me no choice but to stay here forever<br>
        <br>

        "it's time to go"<br>
        <br>
        When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old<br>
        You ask for the tab<br>
        Or that moment again he's insisting that friends<br>
        Look at each other like that<br>
        When the words of a sister come back in whispers<br>
        That prove she was not<br>
        In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams<br>
        She's a crook who was caught<br>
        <br>
        That old familiar body ache<br>
        The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul<br>
        You know when it's time to go<br>
        <br>
        Twenty years at your job<br>
        Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours<br>
        Or trying to stay for the kids<br>
        When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse<br>
        <br>
        That old familiar body ache<br>
        The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul<br>
        You know when it's time to go<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes giving up is the strong thing<br>
        Sometimes to run is the brave thing<br>
        Sometimes walking out is the one thing<br>
        That will find you the right thing<br>
        Sometimes giving up is the strong thing<br>
        Sometimes to run is the brave thing<br>
        Sometimes walking out is the one thing<br>
        That will find you the right thing<br>
        <br>
        Fifteen years, fifteen million tears<br>
        Begging 'til my knees bled<br>
        I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all<br>
        Then wondered why I left<br>
        Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones<br>
        Praying to his greed<br>
        He's got my past frozen behind glass<br>
        But I've got me<br>
        <br>
        That old familiar body ache<br>
        The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul<br>
        I know when it's time to go<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes giving up is the strong thing<br>
        Sometimes to run is the brave thing<br>
        Sometimes walking out is the one thing<br>
        That will find you the right thing<br>
        Sometimes giving up is the strong thing<br>
        Sometimes to run is the brave thing<br>
        Sometimes walking out is the one thing<br>
        That will find you the right thing<br>
        That will find you the right thing<br>
        And you know in your soul<br>
        You know in your soul<br>
        When it's time to go<br>
        You know, you know, you know, you know<br>
        When it's time to go<br>
        So then you go<br>
        Then you go<br>
        You just go<br>
        <br>
