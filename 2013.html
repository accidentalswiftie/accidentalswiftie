        <h4>"Sweeter Than Fiction"</h4>
        <br>
        Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh<br>
        Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"<br>
        You never saw it comin'<br>
        Slipped when you started runnin'<br>
        And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I<br>
        <br>
        Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh<br>
        Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade<br>
        Wish I could make it better<br>
        Someday you won't remember<br>
        This pain you thought would last forever and ever<br>
        <br>
        There you'll stand, ten feet tall<br>
        I will say, "I knew it all along."<br>
        Your eyes are wider than distance<br>
        This life is sweeter than fiction<br>
        <br>
        Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh<br>
        All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes<br>
        They never saw it comin'<br>
        You hit the ground runnin'<br>
        And now you're onto something, I, I, I say<br>
        <br>
        What a sight, what a sight when the light came on<br>
        Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong<br>
        And in this perfect weather<br>
        It's like we don't remember<br>
        The rain we thought would last forever and ever<br>
        <br>
        There you'll stand, ten feet tall<br>
        I will say, "I knew it all along."<br>
        Your eyes are wider than distance<br>
        This life is sweeter than fiction<br>
        <br>
        There you'll stand, next to me<br>
        All at once, the rest is history<br>
        Your eyes are wider than distance<br>
        This life is sweeter than fiction (than fiction)<br>
        <br>
        I'll be one of the many saying,<br>
        "Look at you now, look at you now, now."<br>
        I'll be one of the many saying,<br>
        "You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."<br>
        I'll be one of the many saying,<br>
        "Look at you now, look at you now, now."<br>
        I'll be one of the many saying,<br>
        "You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."<br>
        <br>
        And when they call your name<br>
        and they put your picture in a frame<br>
        You know that I'll be there time and again<br>
        'Cause I loved you when, when you<br>
        <br>
        Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh<br>
        Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"<br>
        Now in this perfect weather<br>
        It's like we don't remember<br>
        The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)<br>
        <br>
        There you'll stand, ten feet tall (ten feet tall)<br>
        I will say, "I knew it all along." (I knew it all along)<br>
        Your eyes are wider than distance (your eyes)<br>
        This life is sweeter than fiction<br>
        <br>
        There you'll stand next to me (next to me)<br>
        All at once, the rest is history (ooooh)<br>
        Your eyes are wider than distance (your eyes)<br>
        This life is sweeter than fiction (than fiction)<br>
        <br>
        It's sweeter than fiction<br>
        It's sweeter, yeah<br>
        It's sweeter than, sweeter<br>
        Sweeter than fiction<br>
