        "Renegade"<br>
        (Big Red Machine feat. Taylor Swift)<br>
        <br>
        I tapped on your window on your darkest night<br>
        The shape of you<br>
        Was jagged and weak<br>
        There was nowhere for me to stay<br>
        But I stayed anyway<br>
        And if I would've known<br>
        How many pieces you had crumbled into<br>
        I might have let them lay<br>
        <br>
        Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?<br>
        And let all your damage, damage me<br>
        And carry your baggage up my street<br>
        And make me your future history<br>
        <br>
        It's time, you've come a long way<br>
        Open the blinds, let me see your face<br>
        You wouldn't be the first renegade<br>
        To need somebody<br>
        <br>
        Is it insensitive for me to say<br>
        Get your shit together<br>
        So I can love you?<br>
        Is it really your anxiety<br>
        That stops you from giving me everything<br>
        Or do you just not want to?<br>
        <br>
        I tapped on your window on your darkest night<br>
        The shape of you<br>
        Was jagged and weak<br>
        There was nowhere for me to stay<br>
        But I stayed anyway<br>
        You fire off missiles cause you hate yourself<br>
        But do you know you're demolishing me?<br>
        And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave<br>
        <br>
        Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?<br>
        Let all your damage, damage me<br>
        And carry your baggage up my street<br>

        Or do you just not want to?<br>
        <br>
        And if I would've known<br>
        How sharp the pieces were<br>
        You'd crumbled into<br>
        I might've let them lay<br>

        I need somebody<br>
        To need somebody<br>
        To need somebody<br>
