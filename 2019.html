        <h3>“Lover” (released August 23, 2019)</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>"I Forgot That You Existed"</h4>
        <br>
        How many days did I spend thinking<br>
        'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?<br>
        Lived in the shade you were throwing<br>
        'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone<br>
        And I couldn't get away from ya<br>
        In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah<br>
        Your name on my lips, tongue-tied<br>
        Free rent, living in my mind<br>
        <br>
        But then something happened one magical night<br>
        <br>
        I forgot that you existed<br>
        And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br>
        And it was so nice<br>
        So peaceful and quiet<br>
        I forgot that you existed<br>
        It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference<br>
        I forgot that you<br>
        <br>
        Got out some popcorn<br>
        As soon as my rep started going down, down, down<br>
        Laughed on the school yard<br>
        As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground<br>
        And I would've stuck around for ya<br>
        Would've fought the whole town, so yeah<br>
        Would've been right there, front row<br>
        Even if nobody came to your show<br>
        <br>
        But you showed who you are, then one magical night<br>
        <br>
        I forgot that you existed<br>
        And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br>
        And it was so nice<br>
        So peaceful and quiet<br>
        I forgot that you existed<br>
        It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference<br>
        I forgot that you<br>
        <br>
        Sent me a clear message<br>
        Taught me some hard lessons<br>
        I just forget what they were<br>
        It's all just a blur<br>
        <br>
        I forgot that you existed<br>
        And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br>
        And it was so nice<br>
        So peaceful and quiet<br>
        I forgot that you existed<br>
        I did, I did, I did<br>
        It isn't hate, it's just indifference<br>
        It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference<br>
        So, yeah<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4> "Cruel Summer"</h4>
        (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
        <br>
        Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br>
        You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
        Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price<br>
        You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
        <br>
        Killing me slow, out the window<br>
        I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below<br>
        Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
        What doesn't kill me makes me want you more<br>
        <br>
        And it's new, the shape of your body<br>
        It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
        And it's ooh, whoa oh<br>
        It's a cruel summer<br>
        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
        No rules in breakable heaven<br>
        But ooh, whoa oh<br>
        It's a cruel summer<br>
        With you<br>
        <br>
        Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine<br>
        I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
        We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br>
        We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
        <br>
        So cut the headlights, summer's a knife<br>
        I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<br>
        Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
        And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know<br>
        <br>
        Oh, it's new, the shape of your body<br>
        It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
        And it's ooh, whoa oh<br>
        It's a cruel summer<br>
        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
        No rules in breakable heaven<br>
        But ooh, whoa oh<br>
        It's a cruel summer<br>
        With you<br>
        <br>
        I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
        And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)<br>
        Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true<br>
        I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
        And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
        Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)<br>
        And I scream, "For whatever it's worth<br>
        I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"<br>
        He looks up, grinning like a devil<br>
        <br>
        It's new, the shape of your body<br>
        It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
        And it's ooh, whoa oh<br>
        It's a cruel summer<br>
        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
        No rules in breakable heaven<br>
        But ooh, whoa oh<br>
        It's a cruel summer<br>
        With you<br>
        <br>
        I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
        And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)<br>
        Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true<br>
        I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
        And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
        Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)<br>
        And I scream, "For whatever it's worth<br>
        I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"<br>
        (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Lover"</h4> <br>
        We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January<br>
        This is our place, we make the rules<br>
        And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear<br>
        Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?<br>
        <br>
        Can I go where you go?<br>
        Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
        And ah, take me out and take me home<br>
        You're my, my, my, my<br>
        Lover<br>
        <br>
        We could let our friends crash in the living room<br>
        This is our place, we make the call<br>
        And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you<br>
        I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all<br>
        <br>
        Can I go where you go?<br>
        Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
        And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)<br>
        You're my, my, my, my<br>
        Lover<br>
        <br>
        Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?<br>
        With every guitar string scar on my hand<br>
        I take this magnetic force of a man to be my<br>
        Lover<br>
        My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue<br>
        All's well that ends well to end up with you<br>
        Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my<br>
        Lover<br>
        <br>
        And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me<br>
        And at every table, I'll save you a seat<br>
        Lover<br>
        <br>
        Can I go where you go?<br>
        Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
        And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)<br>
        You're my, my, my, my<br>
        Oh, you're my, my, my, my<br>
        Darling, you're my, my, my, my<br>
        Lover<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"The Man"</h4>
        <br>
        I would be complex, I would be cool<br>
        They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to<br>
        And that would be okay for me to do<br>
        Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you<br>
        <br>
        I'd be a fearless leader<br>
        I'd be an alpha type<br>
        When everyone believes ya<br>
        What's that like?<br>
        <br>
        I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
        Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man<br>
        And I'm so sick of them coming at me again<br>
        'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        <br>
        They'd say I hustled, put in the work<br>
        They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve<br>
        What I was wearing, if I was rude<br>
        Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves<br>
        <br>
        And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play<br>
        I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez<br>
        <br>
        I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
        Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man<br>
        And I'm so sick of them coming at me again<br>
        'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        <br>
        What's it like to brag about raking in dollars<br>
        And getting bitches and models?<br>
        And it's all good if you're bad<br>
        And it's okay if you're mad<br>
        If I was out flashing my dollars<br>
        I'd be a bitch, not a baller<br>
        They'd paint me out to be bad<br>
        So, it's okay that I'm mad<br>
        <br>
        I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
        Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)<br>
        And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)<br>
        'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)<br>
        Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)<br>
        I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)<br>
        Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)<br>
        And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)<br>
        'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man (Oh)<br>
        I'd be the man (Yeah)<br>
        I'd be the man (I'd be the man)<br>
        <br>
        If I was a man, then I'd be the man<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"The Archer"</h4> <br>
        Combat<br>
        I'm ready for combat<br>
        I say I don't want that<br>
        But what if I do?<br>
        <br>
        'Cause cruelty<br>
        Wins in the movies<br>
        I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches<br>
        I almost said to you<br>
        <br>
        Easy they come<br>
        Easy they go<br>
        I jump from the train<br>
        I ride off alone<br>
        I never grew up<br>
        It's getting so old<br>
        Help me hold on to you<br>
        <br>
        I've been the archer<br>
        I've been the prey<br>
        Who could ever leave me darling...<br>
        But who could stay?<br>
        <br>
        Dark side<br>
        I search for your dark side<br>
        But what if I'm alright<br>
        Right, right, right here?<br>
        <br>
        And I cut off<br>
        My nose just to spite my face<br>
        Then I hate my reflection<br>
        For years and years<br>
        <br>
        I wake in the night<br>
        I pace like a ghost<br>
        The room is on fire<br>
        Invisible smoke<br>
        And all of my heroes<br>
        Die all alone<br>
        Help me hold on to you<br>
        <br>
        I've been the archer<br>
        I've been the prey<br>
        Screaming, "Who could ever leave me darling...<br>
        But who could stay?"<br>
        <br>
        (I see right through me, I see right through me)<br>
        <br>
        'Cause they see right through me<br>
        They see right through me<br>
        They see right through<br>
        Can you see right through me?<br>
        They see right through<br>
        They see right through me<br>
        I see right through me<br>
        I see right through me<br>
        <br>
        All the king's horses<br>
        All the king's men<br>
        Couldn't put me together again<br>
        'Cause all of my enemies<br>
        Started out friends<br>
        Help me hold on to you<br>
        <br>
        I've been the archer<br>
        I've been the prey<br>
        Who could ever leave me darling...<br>
        But who could stay?<br>

        I think he knows<br>
        His footprints on the sidewalk<br>
        Lead to where I can't stop<br>
        Go there every night<br>
        I think he knows<br>
        His hands around a cold glass<br>
        Make me wanna know that<br>

        No one understands<br>

        I think he knows<br>
        When we get all alone<br>
        I'll make myself at home<br>
        And he'll want me to stay<br>
        I think he knows<br>
        He better lock it down<br>
        Or I won't stick around<br>
        'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)<br>
        <br>
        He got that boyish look that I like in a man<br>

        <h4>"Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince"</h4>
        <br>
        You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you<br>
        Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene<br>
        Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing<br>
        I'm lost in the lights<br>
        American glory faded before me<br>
        Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress<br>
        Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard<br>
        And ran for my life (Ah)<br>
        <br>
        No cameras catch my pageant smile<br>
        I counted days, I counted miles<br>
        To see you there, to see you there<br>
        It's been a long time coming, but<br>
        <br>
        It's you and me, that's my whole world<br>
        They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)<br>
        The whole school is rolling fake dice<br>
        You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes<br>
        It's you and me, there's nothing like this<br>
        Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)<br>
        We're so sad, we paint the town blue<br>
        Voted most likely to run away with you<br>
        <br>
        My team is losing, battered and bruising<br>
        I see the high fives between the bad guys<br>
        Leave with my head hung, you are the only one<br>
        Who seems to care<br>
        American stories burning before me<br>
        I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed<br>
        Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?<br>
        Darling, I'm scared (Ah)<br>
        <br>
        No cameras catch my muffled cries<br>
        I counted days, I counted miles<br>
        To see you there, to see you there<br>
        And now the storm is coming, but<br>
        <br>
        It's you and me, that's my whole world<br>
        They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)<br>

        <br>
        The moon is high<br>
        Like your friends were the night that we first met<br>
        Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet<br>
        Now I've read all of the books beside your bed<br>
        The wine is cold<br>
        Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street<br>
        Cat and mouse for a month or two or three<br>
        Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe<br>
        <br>
        (Ayy)<br>
        Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)<br>
        Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)<br>
        Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)<br>
        <br>
        I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings<br>
        Uh huh, that's right<br>
        Darling, you're the one I want, and<br>
        I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this<br>
        Uh huh, that's right<br>
        Darling, you're the one I want<br>
        In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams<br>
        Oh, you're the one I want<br>
        <br>
        In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool<br>
        When you jumped in first, I went in too<br>
        I'm with you even if it makes me blue<br>
        Which takes me back<br>
        To the color that we painted your brother's wall<br>
        Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws<br>
        We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so<br>
        <br>

        <h4>"Cornelia Street"</h4>
        <br>
        We were in the backseat<br>
        Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar<br>
        "I rent a place on Cornelia Street"<br>
        I say casually in the car<br>
        We were a fresh page on the desk<br>
        Filling in the blanks as we go<br>
        As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head<br>
        Leading us home<br>
        <br>
        And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends<br>
        I'd never walk Cornelia Street again<br>
        That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend<br>
        I'd never walk Cornelia Street again<br>
        And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name<br>
        And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away<br>
        I'd never walk Cornelia Street again<br>
        I'd never walk Cornelia Street again<br>
        <br>
        Windows flung right open, autumn air<br>
        Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours<br>
        We bless the rains on Cornelia Street<br>
        Memorize the creaks in the floor<br>
        Back when we were card sharks, playing games<br>
        I thought you were leading me on<br>
        I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street<br>
        Before you even knew I was gone<br>
        <br>
        But then you called, showed your hand<br>
        I turned around before I hit the tunnel<br>
        Sat on the roof, you and I<br>
        <br>
        I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends<br>
        I'd never walk Cornelia Street again<br>
        That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend<br>

        <br>
        You hold my hand on the street<br>
        Walk me back to that apartment<br>
        Years ago, we were just inside<br>
        Barefoot in the kitchen<br>
        Sacred new beginnings<br>
        That became my religion, listen<br>
        <br>
        I hope I never lose you<br>
        I'd never walk Cornelia Street again<br>
        Oh, never again<br>

        Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts<br>
        Flashbacks waking me up<br>
        I get drunk, but it's not enough<br>
        'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby<br>
        I look through the windows of this love<br>
        Even though we boarded them up<br>
        Chandelier's still flickering here<br>
        'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not<br>
        It's death by a thousand cuts<br>
        <br>
        I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home<br>
        I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright<br>
        They say, "I don't know"<br>
        And what once was ours is no one's now<br>
        I see you everywhere, the only thing we share<br>
        Is this small town<br>
        You said it was a great love, one for the ages<br>
        But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?<br>

        Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch<br>
        Gave up on me like I was a bad drug<br>
        Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club<br>
        Our songs, our films, united we stand<br>
        Our country, guess it was a lawless land<br>
        Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand<br>
        Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans<br>
        My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust<br>
        Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up<br>
        Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough<br>
        But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts<br>

        I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal<br>
        And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey<br>

        In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared<br>
        That was the first time we were there<br>
        Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you<br>
        Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too<br>

        We were crazy to think<br>
        Crazy to think that this could work<br>
        Remember how I said I'd die for you?<br>
        We were stupid to jump<br>
        In the ocean separating us<br>
        Remember how I'd fly to you?<br>
        <br>
        And I can't talk to you when you're like this<br>
        Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town<br>
        I'm New York City, I still do it for you, babe<br>
        They all warned us about times like this<br>
        They say the road gets hard and you get lost<br>
        When you're led by blind faith, blind faith<br>
        <br>
        But we might just get away with it<br>
        Religion's in your lips<br>
        Even if it's a false god<br>

        I know heaven's a thing<br>
        I go there when you touch me, honey<br>
        Hell is when I fight with you<br>
        But we can patch it up good<br>
        Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness<br>
        Got the wine for you<br>
        <br>
        And you can't talk to me when I'm like this<br>
        Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you<br>
        You're the West Village<br>
        You still do it for me, babe<br>

        <br>
        Say it in the street, that's a knock-out<br>

        <br>

        But I've learned the lesson<br>
        That stressing and obsessing<br>
        'Bout somebody else is no fun<br>

        Just making that sign<br>
        Must've taken all night<br>
        <br>
        You just need to take several seats<br>
        And then try to restore the peace<br>
        And control your urges to scream<br>
        About all the people you hate<br>
        'Cause shade never made anybody less gay<br>

        I pinned your hands behind your back, oh<br>
        Thought I had reason to attack, but no<br>
        <br>
        Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves<br>
        Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us<br>

        Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh<br>
        <br>
        I lived like an island, punished you with silence<br>
        Went off like sirens, just crying<br>

        We're sneakin' out into town<br>
        Holdin' hands, just killin' time<br>
        <br>
        Your past and mine are parallel lines<br>
        Stars all aligned and they intertwined<br>
        And taught you<br>
        The way you call me "baby"<br>
        Treat me like a lady<br>
        All that I can say is<br>
        <br>
        All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)<br>
        Made you the one I've fallen for<br>
        Every dead-end street led you straight to me<br>
        Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for<br>
        All of the girls you loved before<br>
        But I love you more<br>
        <br>
        When I think of all the makeup<br>
        Fake love out on the town (Ooh)<br>
        Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude<br>
        Whose name I cannot remember now<br>
        <br>
        Secret jokes all alone<br>
        No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)<br>
        We're breakin' up, makin' up<br>
        Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)<br>
        <br>
        And just know that<br>
        It's everything that made me<br>
        Now I call you "baby"<br>
        That's why you're so amazing<br>
        <br>
        All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)<br>
        Made you the one I've fallen for<br>
        Every dead-end street led you straight to me<br>
        Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for<br>
        All of the girls you loved before<br>
        But I love you more<br>
        <br>
        Your mother brought you up loyal and kind<br>
        Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye<br>
        Every woman that you knew brought you here<br>
        I wanna teach you how forever feels like<br>
        <br>
        The girls you loved before (Ooh)<br>
        Made you the one I've fallen for<br>
        Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)<br>
        Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for<br>
        All of the girls you loved before<br>
        But I love you more<br>
        <br>
        (I love you more)<br>
        (I love you more)<br>
        <br>

        <h4>"Beautiful Ghosts"</h4>
        <br>
        Follow me home if you dare to<br>
        I wouldn't know where to lead you<br>
        Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?<br>
        So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start<br>
        With no beauty in my memory<br>
        <br>
        All that I wanted was to be wanted<br>
        Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted<br>
        Born into nothing<br>
        At least you have something, something to cling to<br>
        Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into<br>
        <br>
        And the memories were lost long ago<br>
        But at least you have beautiful ghosts<br>
        <br>
        Perilous night, their voices calling<br>
        A flicker of light before the dawning<br>
        Out here, the wild ones<br>
        Are taming the fear within me<br>
        Scared to call them my friends and be broken again<br>
        Is this hope just a mystical dream?<br>
        <br>
        All that I wanted was to be wanted<br>
        Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted<br>
        Born into nothing<br>
        At least you have something, something to cling to<br>
        Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into<br>
        <br>
        And the memories were lost long ago<br>
        But at least you have beautiful ghosts<br>
        <br>
        And so maybe my home isn't what I had known<br>
        What I thought it would be<br>
        But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night<br>
        And I know that this life isn't safe but it's wild and it's free<br>
        <br>
        All that I wanted was to be wanted<br>
        I'll never wander London streets alone and haunted<br>
        Born into nothing<br>
        With them I have something, something to cling to<br>
        I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into<br>
        <br>
        And the memories were lost long ago<br>
        So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts<br>
        And the memories were lost long ago<br>
        So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts<br>
        <br>

        <h4>"Christmas Tree Farm"</h4>
        <br>
        My winter nights are taken up by static<br>
        Stress, and holiday shopping traffic<br>
        But I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else<br>
        Just like magic<br>
        <br>
        In my heart is a Christmas tree farm<br>
        Where the people would come<br>
        To dance under sparkling lights<br>
        Bundled up in their mittens and coats<br>
        And the cider would flow<br>
        And I just wanna be there tonight<br>
        <br>
        Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon<br>
        Mistakes are forgiven<br>
        And everything is icy and blue<br>
        And you would be there too<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>
        And telling me, "I love you"<br>
        Just being in your arms<br>
        Takes me back to that little farm<br>
        Where every wish comes true<br>
        <br>
        In my heart is a Christmas tree farm<br>
        There's a light in the barn<br>
        We'd run inside out from the cold<br>
        In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs<br>
        And they're warm and they're safe<br>
        They wake to see a blanket of snow<br>
        <br>
        Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon<br>
        Mistakes are forgiven<br>
        And everything is icy and blue<br>
        And you would be there too<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>
        And telling me, "I love you"<br>
        Just being in your arms<br>
        Takes me back to that little farm<br>
        Where every wish comes true<br>
        (Baby, yeah!)<br>
        <br>
        And when I'm feeling alone<br>
        You remind me of home<br>
        Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        And when the world isn't fair<br>
        I'll pretend that we're there<br>
        Baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        To you<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe (To you)<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>
        And telling me, "I love you"<br>
        <br>
        Baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        (Darling)<br>
        Baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        I love you<br>
        <br>
        Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        (I just want you to know)<br>
        Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        May your every wish come true<br>
        <br>
