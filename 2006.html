        <h3>“Taylor Swift” (released October 24, 2006)</h3>
        <h4>“Tim McGraw”</h4>
        <p>

            He said the way my blue eyes shined<br>
            Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br> I said, "That's a lie"<br> Just a boy in a Chevy
            truck<br> That had a tendency of gettin' stuck<br> On back roads at night<br> And I was right there
            beside him all summer long<br> And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone<br><br> But when
            you think Tim McGraw<br> I hope you think my favorite song<br> The one we danced to all night long<br>
            The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br> When you think happiness<br> I hope you think that little
            black dress<br> Think of my head on your chest<br> And my old faded blue jeans<br> When you think Tim
            McGraw<br> I hope you think of me<br><br> September saw a month of tears<br> And thankin' God that you
            weren't here<br> To see me like that<br> But in a box beneath my bed<br> Is a letter that you never
            read<br> From three summers back<br> It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet<br> And lookin'
            back on all of that, it's nice to believe<br><br> When you think Tim McGraw<br> I hope you think my
            favorite song<br> The one we danced to all night long<br> The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br> When
            you think happiness<br> I hope you think that little black dress<br> Think of my head on your chest<br>
            And my old faded blue jeans<br> When you think Tim McGraw<br> I hope you think of me<br><br> And I'm
            back for the first time since then<br> I'm standin' on your street<br> And there's a letter left on your
            doorstep<br> And the first thing that you'll read is:<br><br> "When you think Tim McGraw<br> I hope you
            think my favorite song<br> Someday you'll turn your radio on<br> I hope it takes you back to that
            place"<br><br> When you think happiness<br> I hope you think that little black dress<br> Think of my
            head on your chest<br> And my old faded blue jeans<br> When you think Tim McGraw<br> I hope you think of
            me<br><br> Oh, think of me<br> Mmmm<br><br> He said the way my blue eyes shined<br> Put those Georgia
            stars to shame that night<br> I said, "That's a lie"<br><br><br>

        <h4> "Picture To Burn"</h4>
        State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy<br> I realize you love
        yourself more than you could
        ever love me<br> So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy<br> That's fine I'll tell mine
        that you're gay!<br> By the way...<br><br> I hate that stupid old pickup truck<br> You never let me
        drive<br> You're a redneck heartbreak<br> Who's really bad at lying<br> So watch me strike a match<br> On
        all my wasted time<br> As far as I'm concerned<br> You're just another picture to burn!<br><br> There's no
        time for tears<br> I'm just sitting here planning my revenge<br> There's nothing stopping me<br> From going
        out with all of your best friends<br> And if you come around saying sorry to me<br> My daddy's gonna show
        you how sorry you'll be<br><br> 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck<br> You never let me drive<br>
        You're a redneck heartbreak<br> Who's really bad at lying<br> So watch me strike a match<br> On all my
        wasted time<br> As far as I'm concerned<br> You're just another picture to burn!<br><br> And if you're
        missing me<br> You'd better keep it to yourself<br> 'Cause coming back around here<br> Would be bad for your
        health...<br><br> 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck<br> You never let me drive<br> You're a redneck
        heartbreak<br> Who's really bad at lying<br> So watch me strike a match<br> On all my wasted time<br> In
        case you haven't heard<br> I really really hate that...<br><br> Stupid old pickup truck<br> You never let me
        drive<br> You're a redneck heartbreak<br> Who's really bad at lying<br> So watch me strike a match<br> On
        all my wasted time<br> As far as I'm concerned<br> You're just another picture to burn!<br><br> Burn, burn,
        burn, baby, burn<br> You're just another picture to burn<br> Baby, burn...<br><br><br>

        <h4> "Teardrops On My Guitar"</h4>
        Drew looks at me<br> I fake a smile so he won't see<br> That I want and I'm needing<br> Everything that we
        should be<br><br> I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about<br> And she's got everything that I
        have to live without<br><br> Drew talks to me<br> I laugh 'cause it's just so funny<br> That I can't even
        see<br> Anyone when he's with me<br><br> He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right<br> I wonder if
        he knows he's all I think about at night<br><br> He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br> The only
        thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br> He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I
        do<br><br> Drew walks by me<br> Can he tell that I can't breathe?<br> And there he goes, so perfectly<br>
        The kind of flawless I wish I could be<br><br> She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love<br> Look
        in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause<br><br> He's the reason for the teardrops on my
        guitar<br> The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br> He's the song in the car I keep
        singing. Don't know why I do<br><br> So, I drive home alone<br> As I turn out the light<br> I'll put his
        picture down<br> And maybe get some sleep tonight<br><br> 'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my
        guitar<br> The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart<br> He's the song in the car I keep
        singing. Don't know why I do<br><br> He's the time taken up, but there's never enough<br> And he's all that
        I need to fall into<br><br> Drew looks at me<br> I fake a smile so he won't see<br><br>
        <h4> "A Place In This World"
        </h4>
        I don't know what I want, so don't ask me<br> 'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out<br> Don't know what's
        down this road, I'm just walking<br> Trying to see through the rain coming down<br> Even though I'm not the
        only one<br> Who feels the way I do<br><br> I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know<br> I'll be strong,
        I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on<br> Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world<br><br> Got
        the radio on, my old blue jeans<br> And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve<br> Feeling lucky today, got the
        sunshine<br> Could you tell me what more do I need<br> And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah<br> But that's
        OK<br><br> I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know<br> I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes
        on<br> Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world<br><br> Maybe I'm just a girl on a
        mission<br> But I'm ready to fly<br><br> I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know<br> I'll be strong,
        I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on<br> Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know<br> Oh I'm just a
        girl, trying to find a place in this world<br><br> Oh I'm just a girl<br> Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh<br> Oh
        I'm just a girl<br>

        <h4>"Cold As You"</h4>
        You have a way of coming easily to me<br>
        And when you take, you take the very best of me<br>
        So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something<br>
        And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted<br><br>
        Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day<br> Just walk away, ain't no use defending
        words that you will never say<br> And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through<br> I've never been
        anywhere cold as you<br><br> You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray<br> And I stood there
        loving you and wished them all away<br> And you come away with a great little story<br> Of a mess of a
        dreamer with the nerve to adore you<br><br> Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day<br>
        So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say<br> And now that I'm sitting here
        thinking it through<br> I've never been anywhere cold as you<br><br> You never did give a damn thing, honey,
        but I cried, cried for you<br> And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for
        you<br><br> Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day<br> Every smile you fake is so
        condescending counting all the scars you made<br> And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through<br> I've
        never been anywhere cold as you<br><br>

        <h4>"The Outside"</h4>

        I didn't know what I would find<br>
        When I went looking for a reason<br>
        I know I didn't read between the lines<br>
        And, baby, I've got nowhere to go<br>
        <br>
        I tried to take the road less traveled by<br>
        But nothing seems to work the first few times<br>
        Am I right?<br>
        <br>
        So how can I ever try to be better?<br>
        Nobody ever lets me in<br>
        I can still see you<br>
        This ain't the best view<br>
        On the outside looking in<br>
        And I've been a lot of lonely places<br>
        I've never been on the outside<br>
        <br>
        You saw me there, but never knew<br>
        That I would give it all up to be<br>
        A part of this, a part of you<br>
        And now it's all too late. So you see<br>
        <br>
        You could've helped if you had wanted to<br>
        But no one notices until it's too late to do anything<br>
        <br>
        So how can I ever try to be better?<br>
        Nobody ever lets me in<br>
        I can still see you<br>
        This ain't the best view<br>
        On the outside looking in<br>
        And I've been a lot of lonely places<br>
        I've never been on the outside<br>
        <br>
        Oh, yeah<br>
        <br>
        So how can I ever try to be better?<br>
        Nobody ever lets me in<br>
        And I can still see you<br>
        This ain't the best view<br>
        On the outside looking in<br>
        And I've been a lot of lonely places<br>
        I've never been on the outside<br>
        <br>

        <h4>"Tied Together With A Smile"</h4>
        <br>
        Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty<br>
        Is the face in the mirror looking back at you<br>
        You walk around here thinking you're not pretty<br>
        But that's not true 'cause I know you<br>
        <br>
        Hold on, baby, you're losing it<br>
        The water's high, you're jumping into it<br>
        And letting go<br>
        And no one knows<br>
        That you cry, but you don't tell anyone<br>
        That you might not be the golden one<br>
        And you're tied together with a smile<br>
        But you're coming undone<br>
        <br>
        I guess it's true that love was all you wanted<br>
        'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change<br>
        Hoping it will end up in his pocket<br>
        But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain<br>
        <br>
        Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay<br>
        It's not his price to pay<br>
        <br>
        Hold on, baby, you're losing it<br>
        The water's high, you're jumping into it<br>
        And letting go<br>
        And no one knows<br>
        That you cry, but you don't tell anyone<br>
        That you might not be the golden one<br>
        And you're tied together with a smile<br>
        But you're coming undone<br>
        <br>
        Hold on, baby, you're losing it<br>
        The water's high, you're jumping into it<br>
        And letting go<br>
        And no one knows<br>
        That you cry, but you don't tell anyone<br>
        That you might not be the golden one<br>
        And you're tied together with a smile<br>
        But you're coming undone<br>
        <br>
        You're tied together with a smile<br>
        But you're coming undone<br>
        Goodbye, baby<br>
        With a smile, baby, baby<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Stay Beautiful"</h4>
        <br>
        Cory's eyes are like a jungle<br>
        He smiles, it's like the radio<br>
        He whispers songs into my window<br>
        In words that nobody knows<br>
        There's pretty girls on every corner<br>
        That watch him as he's walking home<br>
        Saying, "Does he know?"<br>
        Will you ever know?<br>
        <br>
        You're beautiful<br>
        Every little piece love<br>
        And don't you know<br>
        You're really gonna be someone<br>
        Ask anyone<br>
        And when you find everything you looked for<br>
        I hope your life leads you back to my door<br>
        Oh, but if it don't<br>
        Stay beautiful<br>
        <br>
        Cory finds another way to be<br>
        The highlight of my day<br>
        I'm taking pictures in my mind<br>
        So I can save them for a rainy day<br>
        It's hard to make a conversation<br>
        When he's taking my breath away<br>
        I should say, hey, by the way<br>
        <br>
        You're beautiful<br>
        Every little piece love<br>
        And don't you know<br>
        You're really gonna be someone<br>
        Ask anyone<br>
        And when you find everything you looked for<br>
        I hope your life leads you back to my door<br>
        Oh, but if it don't<br>
        Stay beautiful<br>
        <br>
        If you and I are a story<br>
        That never gets told<br>
        If what you are is a daydream<br>
        I'll never get to hold<br>
        At least you'll know<br>
        <br>
        You're beautiful<br>
        Every little piece love<br>
        And don't you know<br>
        You're really gonna be someone<br>
        Ask anyone<br>
        And when you find everything you looked for<br>
        I hope your life leads you back to my front door<br>
        Oh, but if it don't<br>
        Will you stay<br>
        Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful<br>
        Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?<br>
        La la la<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, but if it don't<br>
        Stay beautiful<br>
        Stay beautiful<br>
        Na, na, na, na, na<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Should've Said No"<br>
        <br>
        It's strange to think the songs we used to sing<br>
        The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone<br>
        Yesterday I found out about you<br>
        Even now just looking at you feels wrong<br>
        <br>
        You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance<br>
        It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        You should've said "No", you should've gone home<br>
        You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
        You should've known that word<br>
        'Bout what you did with her'd<br>
        Get back to me (get back to me).<br>
        And I should've been there in the back of your mind<br>
        I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"<br>
        You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...<br>
        You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me<br>
        <br>
        You can see that I've been crying<br>
        And baby, you know all the right things to say<br>
        But do you honestly expect me to believe<br>
        We could ever be the same?<br>
        <br>
        You say that the past is the past, you need one chance<br>
        It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        You should've said "No", you should've gone home<br>
        You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
        You should've known that word<br>
        'Bout what you did with her'd,<br>

        I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"<br>
        You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...<br>
        You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me<br>
        <br>
        I can't resist<br>
        Before you go, tell me this:<br>
        Was it worth it?<br>
        Was she worth this?<br>
        <br>
        No... no, no, no...<br>
        <br>
        You should've said "No", you should've gone home<br>
        You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
        You should've known that word<br>
        'Bout what you did with her'd,<br>

        <br>
        <h4>"Mary's Song (Oh My My My)"</h4>
        <br>
        She said, I was seven and you were nine<br>
        I looked at you like the stars that shined<br>
        In the sky, the pretty lights<br>
        And our daddies used to joke about the two of us<br>
        Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled<br>
        And rolled their eyes and said, "Oh my, my, my"<br>
        <br>
        Take me back to the house in the backyard tree<br>
        Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me<br>
        You never did, you never did<br>
        Take me back when our world was one block wide<br>
        I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried<br>
        Just two kids, you and I<br>
        Oh my, my, my, my<br>
        <br>
        Well, I was sixteen when suddenly<br>
        I wasn't that little girl you used to see<br>
        But your eyes still shined like pretty lights<br>
        And our daddies used to joke about the two of us<br>
        They never believed we'd really fall in love<br>
        And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes<br>
        And said, "Oh my, my, my"<br>
        <br>
        Take me back to the creek beds we turned up<br>
        Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me<br>
        Take me back to the time we had our very first fight<br>
        The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight<br>
        You stayed outside 'til the morning light<br>
        Oh my, my, my, my<br>
        <br>
        A few years had gone and come around<br>
        We were sitting at our favorite spot in town<br>
        And you looked at me, got down on one knee<br>
        <br>
        Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle<br>
        Our whole town came and our mamas cried<br>
        You said "I do" and I did too<br>
        Take me home where we met so many years before<br>
        We'll rock our babies on that very front porch<br>
        After all this time, you and I<br>
        <br>
        I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine<br>
        I'll still look at you like the stars that shine<br>
        In the sky, oh my, my, my<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Our Song"</h4>
        <br>
        I was riding shotgun<br>
        With my hair undone<br>
        In the front seat of his car<br>
        He's got a one-hand feel<br>
        On the steering wheel<br>
        The other on my heart<br>
        I look around, turn the radio down<br>
        He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"<br>
        I say, "Nothing<br>
        I was just thinking<br>
        How we don't have a song"<br>
        And he says...<br>
        <br>
        Our song is the slamming screen door<br>
        Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window<br>
        When we're on the phone and you talk real slow<br>
        'Cause it's late and your mama don't know<br>
        Our song is the way you laugh<br>
        The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have."<br>
        And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"<br>
        Asking God if he could play it again<br>
        <br>
        I was walking up<br>
        The front porch steps<br>
        After everything that day<br>
        Had gone all wrong<br>
        And been trampled on<br>
        And lost and thrown away<br>
        Got to the hallway,<br>
        Well, on my way<br>
        To my lovin' bed<br>
        I almost didn't notice<br>
        All the roses<br>
        And the note that said...<br>
        <br>
        Our song is the slamming screen door<br>
        Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window<br>
        When we're on the phone and you talk real slow<br>
        'Cause it's late and your mama don't know<br>
        Our song is the way you laugh<br>
        The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"<br>
        And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"<br>
        Asking God if he could play it again<br>
        <br>
        I've heard every album, listened to the radio<br>
        Waited for something to come along<br>
        That was as good as our song...<br>
        <br>
        'Cause our song is the slamming screen door<br>
        Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window<br>
        When we're on the phone and he talks real slow<br>
        'Cause it's late and his mama don't know<br>
        Our song is the way he laughs<br>
        The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"<br>
        And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"<br>
        Asking God if he could play it again<br>
        Play it again<br>
        <br>
        Oh, yeah...<br>
        Oh-oh, yeah<br>
        <br>
        I was riding shotgun<br>
        With my hair undone<br>
        In the front seat of his car<br>
        I grabbed a pen<br>
        And an old napkin<br>
        And I wrote down our song<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"I'm Only Me When I'm With You"</h4>
        <br>
        Friday night beneath the stars<br>
        In a field behind your yard<br>
        You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky<br>
        And sometimes we don't say a thing<br>
        Just listen to the crickets sing<br>
        Everything I need is right here by my side<br>
        <br>
        And I know everything about you<br>
        I don't wanna live without you<br>
        <br>
        I'm only up when you're not down<br>
        Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground<br>
        It's like no matter what I do<br>
        Well, you drive me crazy half the time<br>
        The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true<br>
        And I'm only me when I'm with you<br>
        <br>
        Just a small town boy and girl<br>
        Livin' in a crazy world<br>
        Tryna figure out what is and isn't true<br>
        And I don't try to hide my tears<br>
        My secrets or my deepest fears<br>
        Through it all nobody gets me like you do<br>
        <br>
        And you know everything about me<br>
        You say that you can't live without me<br>
        <br>
        I'm only up when you're not down<br>
        Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground<br>
        It's like no matter what I do<br>
        Well, you drive me crazy half the time<br>
        The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true<br>
        And I'm only me when I'm with you<br>
        <br>
        When I'm with anybody else<br>
        It's so hard to be myself<br>
        And only you can tell<br>
        <br>
        ...That I'm only up when you're not down<br>
        Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground<br>
        It's like no matter what I do<br>
        Well, you drive me crazy half the time<br>
        The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true<br>
        And I'm only me<br>
        Who I wanna be<br>
        Well, I'm only me when I'm with you<br>
        With you<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Invisible"</h4>
        <br>
        She can't see the way your eyes<br>
        Light up when you smile<br>
        She'll never notice how you stop and stare<br>
        Whenever she walks by<br>
        <br>
        And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her<br>
        But you are everything to me<br>
        <br>
        And I just wanna show you<br>
        She don't even know you<br>
        She's never gonna love you like I want to<br>
        And you just see right through me<br>
        But if you only knew me<br>
        We could be a beautiful<br>
        Miracle<br>
        Unbelievable<br>
        Instead of just invisible<br>
        <br>
        There's a fire inside of you<br>
        That can't help but shine through<br>
        She's never gonna see the light<br>
        No matter what you do<br>
        <br>
        And all I think about is how to make you think of me<br>
        And everything that we could be<br>
        <br>
        I just wanna show you<br>
        She don't even know you<br>
        She's never gonna love you like I want to<br>
        And you just see right through me<br>
        But if you only knew me<br>
        We could be a beautiful<br>
        Miracle<br>
        Unbelievable<br>
        Instead of just invisible<br>
        <br>
        Like shadows in a faded light<br>
        Oh, we're invisible<br>
        I just wanna open your eyes<br>
        And make you realize<br>
        <br>
        I just wanna show you<br>
        She don't even know you<br>
        Baby, let me love you<br>
        Let me want you<br>
        You just see right through me<br>
        But if you only knew me<br>
        We could be a beautiful<br>
        Miracle<br>
        Unbelievable<br>
        Instead of just invisible<br>
        <br>
        She can't see the way your eyes<br>
        Light up when you smile<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"A Perfectly Good Heart"</h4> <br>
        Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br>
        Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?<br>
        Why would you wanna make the very first scar?<br>
        Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br>
        <br>
        Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall<br>
        And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall<br>
        No matter what you say, I still can't believe<br>
        That you would walk away<br>
        It don't make sense to me, but<br>
        <br>
        Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br>
        Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?<br>
        Why would you wanna make the very first scar?<br>
        Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br>
        <br>
        It's not unbroken anymore<br>
        How do I get it back the way it was before?<br>
        <br>
        Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br>
        Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?<br>
        Why would you wanna make the very first scar?<br>
        Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a<br>
        <br>
        Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br>
        Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?<br>
        Why would you wanna make the very first scar?<br>
        Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?<br>
