        <h4>"Eyes Open"</h4>
        <br>
        Everybody's waiting<br>
        Everybody's watching<br>
        Even when you're sleeping<br>
        Keep your ey-eyes open<br>
        <br>
        The tricky thing<br>
        Is yesterday we were just children<br>
        Playing soldiers<br>
        Just pretending<br>
        Dreaming dreams with happy endings<br>
        In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords<br>
        But now we've stepped into a cruel world<br>
        Where everybody stands and keeps score<br>
        <br>
        Keep your eyes open<br>
        <br>
        Everybody's waiting for you to break down<br>
        Everybody's watching to see the fallout<br>
        Even when you're sleeping, sleeping<br>
        Keep your ey-eyes open<br>
        Keep your ey-eyes open<br>
        Keep your ey-eyes open<br>
        <br>
        So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard<br>
        Every lesson forms a new scar<br>
        They never thought you'd make it this far<br>
        But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you<br>
        It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now<br>
        But you've got something they don't<br>
        Yeah you've got something they don't<br>
        You've just gotta keep your eyes open<br>
        <br>
        Everybody's waiting for you to break down<br>
        Everybody's watching to see the fallout<br>
        Even when you're sleeping, sleeping<br>
        Keep your ey-eyes open<br>
        Keep your ey-eyes open<br>
        Keep your ey-eyes<br>
        <br>
        Keep your feet ready<br>
        Heartbeat steady<br>
        Keep your eyes open<br>
        Keep your aim locked<br>
        The night goes dark<br>
        Keep your eyes open<br>
        <br>
        Keep your ey-eyes open<br>
        Keep your ey-eyes open<br>

        <br>
        <h4>"State Of Grace (Taylor's Version)"<br></h4>
        <br>
        I'm walking fast through the traffic lights<br>
        Busy streets and busy lives<br>
        And all we know is touch and go<br>
        We are alone with our changing minds<br>
        We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time<br>
        <br>
        And I never saw you coming<br>
        And I'll never be the same<br>
        <br>
        You come around and the armor falls<br>
        Pierce the room like a cannonball<br>
        Now all we know is don't let go<br>
        We are alone, just you and me<br>
        Up in your room, and our slates are clean<br>
        Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes<br>
        <br>
        So you were never a saint<br>
        And I loved in shades of wrong<br>
        We learn to live with the pain<br>
        Mosaic broken hearts<br>
        But this love is brave and wild<br>
        <br>
        And I never saw you coming<br>
        And I'll never be the same<br>
        <br>
        This is a state of grace<br>
        This is the worthwhile fight<br>
        Love is a ruthless game<br>
        Unless you play it good and right<br>
        These are the hands of fate<br>
        You're my Achilles heel<br>
        This is the golden age of something good and right and real<br>
        <br>
        And I never saw you coming<br>
        And I'll never be the same, oh<br>
        And I never saw you coming<br>
        And I'll never be the same<br>
        (So you were never a saint, and I loved in shades of wrong)<br>
        (We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)<br>
        (But this love is brave and wild)<br>
        <br>
        This is a state of grace<br>
        This is the worthwhile fight<br>
        Love is a ruthless game<br>

        "Red (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street<br>
        Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly<br>
        Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall<br>
        Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all<br>
        <br>
        Losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
        Missing him was dark gray, all alone<br>
        Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
        But loving him was red<br>
        <br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        But loving him was red<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        <br>
        Touching him was like<br>
        Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you<br>
        Memorizing him was as<br>
        Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song<br>
        Fighting with him was like<br>
        Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer<br>
        Regretting him was like<br>
        Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong<br>
        <br>
        Losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
        Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)<br>
        Forgetting him was like<br>
        Trying to know somebody you never met<br>
        But loving him was red<br>
        <br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        Oh, red (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        Burning red (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red)<br>
        <br>
        Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes<br>
        Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go<br>
        But moving on from him is impossible<br>
        When I still see it all in my head<br>
        In burning red<br>
        Burning, it was red<br>
        <br>
        Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
        Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)<br>
        Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
        'Cause loving him was red<br>
        <br>
        (Red, red, red; red, red, red)<br>
        Yeah, yeah, red<br>
        (Red, red, red; red, red, red)<br>
        Burning red (Red, red, red; red, red, red)<br>
        (Red, red, red; red, red, red)<br>
        <br>
        And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red, red; red, red, red)<br>
        Comes back to me (Red, red, red; red, red, red), burning red<br>
        (Red, red, red; red, red, red) Yeah, yeah<br>
        (Red, red, red; red, red, red)<br>
        <br>
        His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street<br>

        <br>
        Put your lips close to mine<br>
        As long as they don't touch<br>
        Out of focus, eye to eye<br>
        Till the gravity's too much<br>
        And I'll do anything you say<br>
        If you say it with your hands<br>
        And I'd be smart to walk away<br>
        But you're quicksand<br>
        <br>
        This slope is treacherous<br>
        This path is reckless<br>
        This slope is treacherous<br>
        And I, I, I like it<br>
        <br>
        I can't decide if it's a choice<br>
        Getting swept away<br>
        I hear the sound of my own voice<br>
        Asking you to stay<br>
        All we are is skin and bone<br>
        Trained to get along<br>
        Forever going with the flow<br>
        But you're friction<br>
        <br>
        This slope is treacherous<br>
        This path is reckless<br>
        This slope is treacherous<br>
        I, I, I like it<br>
        <br>
        Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will<br>
        Get you a, get you alone<br>
        Your name has echoed through my mind and I just<br>
        Think you should, think you should know<br>
        That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would<br>
        Follow you, follow you home<br>
        I'll follow you, follow you home<br>
        <br>
        This hope is treacherous<br>
        This daydream is dangerous<br>
        This hope is treacherous<br>
        I, I, I<br>
        I, I, I<br>
        I, I, I<br>
        <br>
        Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will<br>
        Get you a, get you alone<br>
        Your name has echoed through my mind and I just<br>

        I'll follow you, follow you home<br>
        I'll follow you, follow you home<br>
        I'll follow you, follow you home<br>
        <br>
        This slope is treacherous<br>

        "I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago<br>
        I was in your sights, you got me alone<br>
        You found me, you found me, you found me<br>
        I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that<br>
        And when I fell hard, you took a step back<br>
        Without me, without me, without me<br>
        <br>
        And he's long gone when he's next to me<br>
        And I realize the blame is on me<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
        So shame on me now<br>
        Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
        'Til you put me down, oh<br>
        I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
        So shame on me now<br>
        Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
        Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh-oh<br>
        Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
        Oh, oh-oh<br>
        Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
        <br>
        No apologies, he'll never see you cry<br>
        Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why<br>
        You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning<br>
        And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street<br>
        A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be<br>
        And now I see, now I see, now I see<br>
        <br>
        He was long gone when he met me<br>
        And I realize the joke is on me, hey<br>
        <br>
        I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)<br>
        So shame on me now<br>
        Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
        'Til you put me down, oh<br>
        I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
        So shame on me now<br>
        Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)<br>
        Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)<br>
        Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)<br>
        Oh, oh-oh<br>
        Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
        <br>
        And the saddest fear<br>
        Comes creeping in<br>
        That you never loved me<br>
        Or her, or anyone, or anything<br>
        Yeah<br>
        <br>
        I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
        So shame on me now<br>
        Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)<br>
        'Til you put me down, oh<br>
        I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)<br>
        So shame on me now (Knew it right there)<br>
        Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)<br>
        Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh-oh<br>
        Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)<br>
        Oh, oh-oh<br>

        "All Too Well (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        I walked through the door with you<br>
        The air was cold<br>
        But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I<br>
        Left my scarf there at your sister's house<br>
        And you've still got it in your drawer even now<br>
        <br>
        Oh, your sweet disposition<br>
        And my wide-eyed gaze<br>
        We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate<br>
        Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place<br>
        And I can picture it after all these days<br>
        And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more<br>
        And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all, oh-oh-oh<br>
        <br>
        'Cause there we are again on that<br>
        Little town street<br>
        You almost ran the red 'cause you were<br>
        Looking over at me<br>
        Wind in my hair, I was there<br>
        I remember it all too well<br>
        <br>
        Photo album on the counter<br>
        Your cheeks were turning red<br>
        You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed<br>
        And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team<br>
        You taught me about your past, thinking your future was me<br>
        And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do<br>
        And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to<br>
        <br>
        'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night<br>
        We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light<br>
        Down the stairs, I was there<br>
        I remember it all too well, yeah<br>
        <br>
        And maybe we got lost in translation<br>
        Maybe I asked for too much<br>
        But maybe this thing was a masterpiece<br>
        Till you tore it all up<br>
        Running scared, I was there<br>
        I remember it all too well<br>
        <br>
        And you call me up again<br>
        Just to break me like a promise<br>
        So casually cruel in the name of being honest<br>
        I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here<br>
        'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well<br>
        <br>
        Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it<br>
        I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it<br>
        After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own<br>
        Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone<br>
        But you keep my old scarf from that very first week<br>
        'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me<br>
        You can't get rid of it<br>
        'Cause you remember it all too well<br>
        <br>
        'Cause there we are again when I loved you so<br>
        Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known<br>
        It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well<br>
        Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all<br>
        Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all<br>
        It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well<br>

        "22 (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        It feels like a perfect night<br>
        To dress up like hipsters<br>
        And make fun of our exes<br>
        Ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
        It feels like a perfect night<br>
        For breakfast at midnight<br>
        To fall in love with strangers<br>
        Ah ah, ah, ah<br>
        Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time<br>
        It's miserable and magical, oh yeah<br>
        Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time<br>
        Ah, ah<br>
        <br>
        I don't know about you<br>
        But I'm feeling 22<br>
        Everything will be alright if<br>
        You keep me next to you<br>
        You don't know about me<br>
        But I'll bet you want to<br>
        Everything will be alright if<br>
        We just keep dancing like we're<br>
        22<br>
        22<br>
        <br>
        It seems like one of those nights<br>
        This place is too crowded<br>
        Too many cool kids ("Who is Taylor Swift anyway?")<br>
        Ah ah, ah ah<br>
        It seems like one of those nights<br>
        We ditch the whole scene<br>
        And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah<br>
        We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way<br>
        It's miserable and magical, oh yeah<br>
        Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time<br>
        Ah, ah<br>
        <br>
        I don't know about you<br>
        But I'm feeling 22<br>

        "I Almost Do (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        I bet this time of night you're still up<br>
        I bet you're tired from a long hard week<br>
        I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window<br>
        Looking out at the city and I bet<br>
        Sometimes you wonder 'bout me<br>
        <br>
        And I just want to tell you<br>
        It takes everything in me<br>
        Not to call you<br>
        And I wish I could run to you<br>
        And I hope you know that<br>
        Every time I don't<br>
        I almost do<br>
        I almost do<br>
        <br>
        I bet you think I either moved on or hate you<br>
        'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply<br>
        I bet it never, ever occurred to you<br>
        That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye<br>
        <br>
        And I just want to tell you<br>
        It takes everything in me<br>
        Not to call you<br>
        And I wish I could run to you<br>
        And I hope you know that<br>
        Every time I don't<br>
        I almost do, I almost do<br>
        <br>
        Oh, we made quite a mess, babe<br>
        It's probably better off this way<br>
        And I confess, baby<br>
        In my dreams you're touching my face<br>
        And asking me if I'd want to try again with you<br>
        And I almost do<br>
        <br>
        And I just want to tell you<br>
        It takes everything in me<br>
        Not to call you<br>
        And I wish I could run to you<br>
        And I hope you know that<br>

        "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        I remember when we broke up the first time<br>
        Saying, "This is it, I've had enough", 'cause like<br>
        We hadn't seen each other in a month<br>
        When you said you needed space, what?<br>
        Then you come around again and say<br>
        "Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"<br>
        Remember how that lasted for a day?<br>
        I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, we called it off again last night but<br>
        Ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you<br>
        <br>
        We are never ever ever getting back together<br>
        We are never ever ever getting back together<br>
        You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me<br>
        But we are never ever ever ever getting back together<br>
        <br>
        Like, ever<br>
        <br>
        I'm really gonna miss you picking fights<br>
        And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right<br>
        And you would hide away and find your peace of mind<br>
        With some indie record that's much cooler than mine<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, you called me up again tonight but<br>
        Ooh, this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you<br>
        <br>
        We are never ever ever getting back together<br>
        We are never ever ever getting back together<br>
        You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me<br>
        But we are never ever ever ever getting back together<br>
        <br>
        Yeah<br>
        Yeah<br>
        Yeah<br>
        <br>
        I used to think that we were forever ever<br>
        And I used to say never say never<br>
        <br>
        So he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"<br>
        And I'm like, I'm just, I mean this is exhausting you know?<br>
        Like we are never getting back together<br>
        Like, ever<br>
        <br>
        (No)<br>
        We are never ever ever getting back together<br>
        We are never ever ever getting back together<br>
        You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me<br>
        But we are never ever ever ever getting back together<br>
        <br>
        (We)<br>
        No<br>
        (Getting back together)<br>
        (We)<br>
        (Getting back together)<br>
        You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me<br>

        "Stay Stay Stay (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night<br>
        I threw my phone across the room at you<br>
        I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed<br>
        <br>
        This morning I said we should talk about it<br>
        'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved<br>
        That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Ok, let's talk"<br>
        And I said<br>
        <br>
        Stay, stay, stay<br>
        I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time<br>
        You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad<br>
        But I think that it's best if we both stay<br>
        <br>
        Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers<br>
        Who took all of their problems out on me<br>
        But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing<br>
        And I love you because you have given me no choice but to<br>
        <br>
        Stay, stay, stay<br>
        I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time<br>
        You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad<br>
        But I think that it's best if we both stay<br>
        Stay, stay, stay, stay<br>
        <br>
        You took the time to memorize me<br>
        My fears, my hopes and dreams<br>
        I just like hanging out with you<br>
        All the time<br>
        All those times that you didn't leave<br>
        It's been occurring to me<br>
        I'd like to hang out with you<br>
        For my whole life<br>
        <br>
        Stay<br>
        And I'll be loving you for quite some time<br>
        No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad<br>
        So I think that it's best if we both stay<br>
        Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay<br>
        <br>
        Stay, stay, stay<br>
        I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time<br>
        You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad<br>
        But I think that it's best if we both stay<br>
        Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay<br>
        <br>
        Stay, stay, stay<br>
        I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time<br>
        You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad<br>
        But I think that it's best if we both stay<br>
        <br>
        That's so fun<br>

        "The Last Time (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        (feat. Gary Lightbody)<br>
        <br>
        I find myself at your door<br>
        Just like all those times before<br>
        I'm not sure how I got there<br>
        All roads they lead me here<br>
        I imagine you are home<br>
        In your room, all alone<br>
        And you open your eyes into mine<br>
        And everything feels better<br>
        <br>
        And right before your eyes<br>
        I'm breaking, no past<br>
        No reasons why<br>
        Just you and me<br>
        <br>
        This is the last time I'm asking you this<br>
        Put my name at the top of your list<br>
        This is the last time I'm asking you why<br>
        You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye<br>
        <br>
        You find yourself at my door<br>
        And just like all those times before<br>
        You wear your best apology<br>
        But I was there to watch you leave<br>
        And all the times I let you in<br>
        Just for you to go again<br>
        Disappear when you come back<br>
        Everything is better<br>
        <br>
        And right before your eyes<br>
        I'm aching<br>
        No past, nowhere to hide<br>
        Just you and me<br>
        <br>
        This is the last time I'm asking you this<br>
        Put my name at the top of your list<br>
        This is the last time I'm asking you why<br>
        You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye<br>
        <br>
        This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong<br>
        This is the last time I say it's been you all along<br>
        This is the last time I let you in my door<br>
        This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore<br>
        Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho<br>
        Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho<br>

        Put my name at the top of your list<br>

        "Holy Ground (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        I was reminiscing just the other day<br>
        While having coffee all alone<br>
        And Lord it took me away<br>
        Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time<br>
        Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme<br>
        Took off faster than a green light, go<br>
        Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know<br>
        I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made<br>
        And that was the first day<br>
        <br>
        And darling it was good<br>
        Never looking down<br>
        And right there where we stood<br>
        Was holy ground<br>
        <br>
        Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress<br>
        We had this big wide city all to ourselves<br>
        We block the noise with the sound of, "I need you"<br>
        And for the first time I had something to lose<br>
        And I guess we fell apart in the usual way<br>
        And the story's got dust on every page<br>
        But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now<br>
        And I see your face in every crowd<br>
        <br>
        'Cause darling, it was good<br>
        Never looking down<br>
        And right there where we stood<br>
        Was holy ground<br>
        <br>
        Tonight, I'm gonna dance<br>
        For all that we've been through<br>
        But I don't wanna dance<br>
        If I'm not dancing with you<br>
        Tonight, I'm gonna dance<br>
        Like you were in this room<br>
        But I don't wanna dance<br>
        If I'm not dancing with you<br>
        <br>
        It was good<br>
        Never looking down<br>
        And right there where we stood<br>
        Was holy ground<br>
        <br>
        Tonight, I'm gonna dance<br>
        For all that we've been through<br>
        But I don't wanna dance<br>
        If I'm not dancing with you<br>
        Tonight, I'm gonna dance<br>
        Like you were in this room<br>
        But I don't wanna dance<br>

        "Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket<br>
        Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late<br>
        I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket<br>
        Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait<br>
        <br>
        We had a beautiful magic love there<br>
        What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair<br>
        <br>
        In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation<br>
        And we both wake in lonely beds, different cities<br>
        And time is taking its sweet time erasing you<br>
        And you've got your demons<br>
        And darling, they all look like me<br>
        <br>
        'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there<br>
        What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)<br>
        <br>
        Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting<br>
        Silence, the train runs off its tracks<br>
        Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?<br>
        Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back<br>
        A beautiful magic love there<br>
        What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful<br>
        <br>
        What we had, a beautiful magic love there<br>
        What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair<br>
        We had a beautiful magic love there<br>

        "The Lucky One (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        New to town with a made up name<br>
        In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame<br>
        And the camera flashes make it look like a dream<br>
        You had it figured out since you were in school<br>
        Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool<br>
        So overnight, you look like a sixties queen<br>
        <br>
        Another name goes up in lights<br>
        Like diamonds in the sky<br>
        <br>
        And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one<br>
        Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one<br>
        But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        Now, it's big black cars and Riviera views<br>
        And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you<br>
        And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page<br>
        And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused<br>
        'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used<br>
        And all the young things line up to take your place<br>
        <br>
        Another name goes up in lights<br>
        You wonder if you'll make it out alive<br>
        <br>
        And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one<br>
        Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one<br>
        But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        It was a few years later, I showed up here<br>
        And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared<br>
        How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out<br>
        They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere<br>
        Chose the rose garden over Madison Square<br>
        And it took some time, but I understand it now<br>
        <br>
        'Cause now my name is up in lights<br>
        But I think you got it right<br>
        <br>
        Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one<br>
        Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one<br>
        Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh<br>
        Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one<br>
        Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one<br>
        Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh<br>

        <br>
        All I knew this morning when I woke<br>
        Is I know something now<br>
        Know something now I didn't before<br>
        And all I've seen since 18 hours ago<br>
        Is green eyes and freckles and your smile<br>
        In the back of my mind, making me feel like<br>
        <br>
        I just wanna know you better<br>

        And all my walls stood tall, painted blue<br>
        But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down<br>
        And open up the door for you<br>
        And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies<br>
        The beautiful kind, making up for lost time<br>
        Taking flight, making me feel right<br>

        "Starlight (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"<br>
        It was the best night<br>
        Never would forget how he moved<br>
        The whole place was dressed to the nines<br>
        And we were dancing, dancing<br>
        Like we're made of starlight<br>
        Like we're made of starlight<br>
        <br>
        I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45<br>
        Picks me up late one night<br>
        Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild<br>
        Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in<br>
        The night we snuck into a yacht club party<br>
        Pretending to be a duchess and a prince<br>
        <br>
        And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"<br>
        It was the best night, never would forget how he moved<br>
        The whole place was dressed to the nines<br>
        And we were dancing, dancing<br>
        Like we're made of starlight, starlight<br>
        Like we're made of starlight, starlight<br>
        <br>
        He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change<br>
        You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"<br>
        He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me<br>
        "Don't you see the starlight, starlight?<br>
        Don't you dream impossible things?"<br>
        <br>
        Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"<br>
        It was the best night, never would forget how he moved<br>
        The whole place was dressed to the nines<br>
        And we were dancing, dancing<br>
        Like we're made of starlight, starlight<br>
        Like we're made of starlight, starlight<br>
        <br>
        Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy<br>
        Ooh-ooh, dancing with me<br>
        Ooh-ooh, we could get married<br>
        Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream<br>
        <br>
        (Ooh, hoo, hoo)<br>
        (Ooh, hoo, hoo)<br>
        (Ooh, hoo, hoo)<br>

        Like we're made of starlight, starlight<br>
        <br>
        Like we're made of starlight, starlight<br>
        Like we dream impossible dreams<br>
        Like starlight, starlight (Ooh, hoo, hoo)<br>
        Like we dream impossible dreams (Ooh, hoo, hoo)<br>
        <br>
        Don't you see the starlight, starlight? (Ooh, hoo, hoo)<br>
        Don't you dream impossible things?<br>

        <br>
        Took a deep breath in the mirror<br>
        He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do<br>
        Turn the lock and put my headphones on<br>
        He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do<br>
        <br>
        I walked in expecting you'd be late<br>
        But you got here early and you stand and wave<br>
        I walk to you<br>
        You pull my chair out and help me in<br>
        And you don't know how nice that is, but I do<br>
        <br>
        And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid<br>
        I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did<br>
        I've been spending the last eight months<br>
        Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end<br>
        But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again<br>
        <br>
        You said you never met one girl who<br>
        Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do<br>
        We tell stories and you don't know why<br>
        I'm coming off a little shy, but I do<br>
        <br>
        But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid<br>
        I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did<br>
        I've been spending the last eight months<br>
        Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end<br>
        But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again<br>
        <br>
        And we walked down the block to my car<br>
        And I almost brought him up<br>
        But you start to talk about the movies<br>
        That your family watches every single Christmas<br>
        And I wanna talk about that<br>
        And for the first time, what's past is past<br>
        <br>
        'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid<br>
        I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did<br>
        I've been spending the last eight months<br>

        "The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version)" <br>
        <br>
        You should've been there<br>
        Should've burst through the door<br>
        With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile<br>
        And it would've felt like<br>
        A million little shining stars had just aligned<br>
        And I would've been so happy<br>
        <br>
        Christmas lights glisten<br>
        I've got my eye on the door<br>
        Just waiting for you to walk in<br>
        But the time is ticking<br>
        People ask me how I've been<br>
        As I comb back through my memory<br>
        How you said you'd be here<br>
        You said you'd be here<br>
        <br>
        And it was like slow motion<br>
        Standing there in my party dress<br>
        In red lipstick<br>
        With no one to impress<br>
        And they're all laughing<br>
        As I'm looking around the room<br>
        But there was one thing missing<br>
        And that was the moment I knew<br>
        <br>
        And the hours pass by<br>
        Now I just wanna be alone<br>
        But your close friends always seem to know<br>
        When there's something really wrong<br>
        So they follow me down the hall<br>
        And there in the bathroom<br>
        I try not to fall apart<br>
        And the sinking feeling starts<br>
        As I say hopelessly<br>
        "He said he'd be here"<br>
        <br>
        And it was like slow motion<br>
        Standing there in my party dress<br>
        In red lipstick<br>
        With no one to impress<br>
        And they're all laughing<br>
        And asking me about you<br>
        But there was one thing missing (Missing)<br>
        And that was the moment I knew<br>
        <br>
        What do you say<br>
        When tears are streaming down your face<br>
        In front of everyone you know?<br>
        And what do you do<br>
        When the one who means the most to you<br>
        Is the one who didn't show?<br>
        <br>
        You should've been here<br>
        And I would've been so happy<br>
        <br>
        And it was like slow motion<br>
        Standing there in my party dress<br>
        In red lipstick<br>
        With no one to impress<br>
        And they're all standing around me, singing<br>
        "Happy birthday to you"<br>
        But there was one thing missing<br>
        And that was the moment I knew<br>
        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew<br>
        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
        <br>
        You called me later<br>
        And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"<br>
        And I said, "I'm sorry, too"<br>
        And that was the moment I knew<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version)"<br>
        <br>
        You said it in a simple way<br>
        4 AM, the second day<br>
        How strange that I don't know you at all<br>
        Stumbled through the long goodbye<br>
        One last kiss, then catch your flight<br>
        Right when I was just about to fall<br>
        <br>
        I told myself, don't get attached<br>
        But in my mind, I play it back<br>
        Spinning faster than the plane that took you<br>
        <br>
        And this is when the feeling sinks in<br>
        I don't wanna miss you like this<br>
        Come back, be here, come back, be here<br>
        I guess you're in New York today<br>
        I don't wanna need you this way<br>
        Come back, be here, come back, be here<br>
        <br>
        The delicate beginning rush<br>
        The feeling you can know so much<br>
        Without knowing anything at all<br>
        And now that I can put this down<br>
        If I had known what I know now<br>
        I never would've played so nonchalant<br>
        <br>
        Taxi cabs and busy streets<br>
        That never bring you back to me<br>
        I can't help but wish you took me with you<br>
        <br>
        And this is when the feeling sinks in<br>
        I don't wanna miss you like this<br>
        Come back, be here, come back, be here<br>
        I guess you're in London today<br>
        And I don't wanna need you this way<br>
        Come back, be here, come back, be here<br>
        <br>
        This is falling in love in the cruellest way<br>
        This is falling for you when you are worlds away<br>
        In New York, be here<br>
        But you're in London, and I break down<br>
        'Cause it's not fair that you're not around<br>
        <br>
        This is when the feeling sinks in<br>
        I don't wanna miss you like this<br>
        Come back, be here, come back, be here<br>
        I guess you're in New York today<br>

        Don't look at me, you got a girl at home<br>
        And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah<br>
        Don't look at me, you got a girl at home<br>
        And everybody knows that<br>
        <br>
        I don't even know her<br>
        But I feel a responsibility<br>
        To do what's upstanding and right<br>
        It's kinda like a code, yeah<br>
        And you've been getting closer and closer<br>
        And crossing so many lines<br>
        <br>
        And it would be a fine proposition<br>
        If I was a stupid girl<br>
        But, honey, I am no one's exception<br>
        This, I have previously learned<br>

        And everybody knows that, everybody knows that<br>
        I see you turn off your phone<br>
        And now you've got me alone, and I say<br>
        Don't look at me, you got a girl at home<br>
        And everybody knows that, everybody knows that<br>
        <br>
        I just wanna make sure<br>
        You understand perfectly<br>
        You're the kind of man who makes me sad<br>
        While she waits up<br>
        You chase down the newest thing<br>
        And take for granted what you have<br>
        <br>
        And it would be a fine proposition<br>
        If I was a stupid girl<br>
        And, yeah, I might go with it<br>
        If I hadn't once been just like her<br>
        <br>
        So don't look at me, you got a girl at home<br>
        And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah<br>
        Don't look at me, you got a girl at home<br>

        Call a cab, lose my number<br>

        <br>
        I remember your bare feet, down the hallway<br>
        I remember your little laugh<br>
        Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs<br>
        I love you to the moon and back<br>
        I remember your blue eyes looking into mine<br>
        Like we had our own secret club<br>
        I remember you dancing before bed time<br>
        Then jumping on me, waking me up<br>
        I can still feel you hold my hand, little man<br>
        And even the moment I knew<br>
        You fought it hard like an army guy<br>
        Remember I leaned in and whispered to you<br>
        <br>
        "Come on, baby, with me<br>
        We're going to fly away from here<br>
        You were my best four years"<br>
        <br>
        I remember the drive home<br>
        When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"<br>
        Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say<br>
        About a beautiful boy who died<br>
        And it's about to be Halloween<br>
        You could be anything you wanted if you were still here<br>
        I remember the last day, when I kissed your face<br>
        And whispered in your ear<br>
        <br>
        "Come on, baby, with me<br>
        We're going to fly away from here<br>
        Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we'll just disappear<br>
        Come on, baby, with me<br>
        We're going to fly away from here<br>
        You were my best four years"<br>
        <br>
        What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?<br>
        And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?<br>
        And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?<br>
        What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?<br>
        <br>
        Come on, baby, with me<br>
        We're going to fly away from here<br>
        Come on, baby, with me<br>
        We're going to fly away from here<br>
        You were my best four years<br>
        <br>
        I remember your bare feet, down the hallway<br>
        I love you to the moon and back<br>

        "Better Man (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"<br>
        <br>
        I know I'm probably better off on my own<br>
        Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it<br>
        And I see the permanent damage you did to me<br>
        Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic<br>
        <br>
        I wish it wasn't 4AM, standing in the mirror<br>
        Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it"<br>
        I know the bravest thing I ever did was run<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again<br>
        But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br>
        And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand<br>
        But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br>
        A better man<br>
        <br>
        I know I'm probably better off all alone<br>
        Than needing a man who could change his mind<br>
        At any given minute<br>
        And it was always on your terms<br>
        I waited on every careless word<br>
        Hoping they might turn sweet again<br>
        Like it was in the beginning<br>
        <br>
        But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now<br>
        Talking down to me like I'd always be around<br>
        Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun<br>
        Oh, you never thought I'd run<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again<br>
        But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br>
        And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand<br>
        But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br>
        A better man<br>
        <br>
        I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have<br>
        And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that<br>
        I wish you were a better man<br>
        I wonder what we would've become<br>
        If you were a better man<br>
        We might still be in love<br>
        If you were a better man<br>
        You would've been the one<br>
        If you were a better man<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again<br>
        But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br>
        And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand<br>
        But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br>
        A better man<br>
        (Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)<br>
        We might still be in love, if you were a better man<br>
        (But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>
        I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand<br>
        But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man<br>
        A better man<br>
        <br>
        We might still be in love<br>
        If you were a better man<br>
        You would've been the one<br>
        If you were a better man<br>

        "Nothing New (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"<br>
        (feat. Phoebe Bridgers)<br>
        <br>
        They tell you while you're young<br>
        "Girls, go out and have your fun"<br>
        Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it<br>
        Criticize the way you fly<br>
        When you're soaring through the sky<br>
        Shoot you down and then they sigh<br>
        And say, "She looks like she's been through it"<br>
        Lord, what will become of me<br>
        Once I've lost my novelty?<br>
        <br>
        I've had too much to drink tonight<br>
        And I know it's sad but this is what I think about<br>
        And I wake up in the middle of the night<br>
        It's like I can feel time moving<br>
        How can a person know everything at eighteen<br>
        But nothing at twenty-two?<br>
        And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?<br>
        <br>
        How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?<br>
        When you can't blame it on my youth<br>
        And roll your eyes with affection<br>
        And my cheeks are growing tired<br>
        From turning red and faking smiles<br>
        Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention<br>
        And someone else lights up the room?<br>
        People love an ingénue<br>
        <br>
        I've had too much to drink tonight<br>
        How did I go from growing up to breaking down?<br>
        And I wake up in the middle of the night<br>
        It's like I can feel time moving<br>
        How can a person know everything at eighteen<br>
        But nothing at twenty-two?<br>
        And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?<br>
        <br>
        I know someday I'm gonna meet her<br>
        It's a fever dream<br>
        The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen<br>
        She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me<br>
        I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep<br>
        Oh woah, oh woah, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight<br>
        But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out<br>
        I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night<br>
        And I can feel time moving<br>
        How can a person know everything at eighteen<br>
        But nothing at twenty-two?<br>
        And will you still want me, will you still want me<br>
        Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?<br>

        <br>
        What about your promises, promises?<br>
        What about your promises, promises, promises? (No)<br>
        <br>
        What a shame<br>
        Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah<br>
        Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise<br>
        That you never should have made<br>
        <br>
        I'm here on the kitchen floor<br>
        You call, but I won't hear it<br>
        You said, "No one else"<br>
        How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)<br>
        <br>
        You really blew this, babe<br>
        We ain't getting through this one, babe<br>
        This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)<br>
        This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe<br>
        (What about your promises, promises, promises?)<br>
        <br>
        What a waste<br>
        Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah<br>
        And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent<br>
        Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe<br>
        <br>
        I break down every time you call<br>
        We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball<br>
        We said, "No one else"<br>
        How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)<br>
        <br>
        You really blew this, babe<br>
        We ain't getting through this one, babe<br>
        This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)<br>
        This is the last time I'll ever call you<br>
        <br>
        Since you admitted it, I keep picturing<br>
        Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it<br>
        I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe<br>
        What a shame didn't want to be the one that got away<br>
        How could you do this, babe?<br>
        <br>
        You really blew this, babe<br>
        We ain't getting through this one, babe<br>
        This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)<br>
        This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe<br>
        <br>
        I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it<br>
        You said, "No one else"<br>
        We ain't getting through this one, babe<br>
        I break down every time you call<br>
        We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball<br>
        You said, "No one else"<br>
        This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe<br>

        "Message In A Bottle (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"<br>
        <br>
        I know that you like me<br>
        And it's kinda frightening<br>
        Standing here waiting, waiting<br>
        And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes<br>
        Tongue tied<br>
        But, now, you're so far away and I'm down<br>
        Feeling like a face in the crowd<br>
        I'm reaching for you, terrified<br>
        <br>
        'Cause you could be the one that I love<br>
        I could be the one that you dream of<br>
        A message in a bottle is all I can do<br>
        Standing here hoping it gets to you<br>
        You could be the one that I keep<br>
        And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night<br>
        A message in a bottle is all I can do<br>
        Standing here hoping it gets to you<br>
        <br>
        These days I'm restless<br>
        Workdays are endless<br>
        Look how you made me, made me<br>
        But time moves faster<br>
        Replaying your laughter<br>
        Disaster<br>
        <br>
        'Cause, now, you're so far away and I'm down<br>
        Feeling like a face in the crowd<br>

        How is it in London? (London)<br>
        Where were you while I'm wondering (Wondering)<br>
        If I'll ever see you again?<br>
        <br>
        You could be the one that I love<br>

        "I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"<br>
        (feat. Chris Stapleton)<br>
        <br>
        3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine<br>
        Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine<br>
        And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree<br>
        And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh<br>
        <br>
        Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles<br>
        Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love<br>
        Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life<br>
        And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of<br>
        <br>
        But now that we're done and it's over<br>
        I bet you couldn't believe<br>
        When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave<br>
        And I bet you think about me<br>
        <br>
        You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community<br>
        Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills<br>
        I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion<br>
        Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills<br>
        <br>
        But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for<br>
        And you and I fell like an early spring snow<br>
        But reality crept in, you said we're too different<br>
        You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Superior Thinkin'<br>
        Do you have all the space that you need?<br>
        I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy<br>
        And I bet you think about me<br>
        <br>
        I bet you think about me, yes<br>
        I bet you think about me<br>
        <br>
        Oh, block it all out<br>
        The voices so loud, sayin'<br>
        "Why did you let her go?"<br>
        Does it make you feel sad<br>
        That the love that you're lookin' for<br>
        Is the love that you had?<br>
        <br>
        Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul<br>
        Scared not to be hip, scared to get old<br>
        Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free<br>
        Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me<br>
        <br>
        But now that we're done and it's over<br>
        I bet it's hard to believe<br>
        That it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave<br>
        And, yeah, I bet you think about me<br>
        <br>
        I bet you think about me, yes<br>
        I bet you think about me<br>
        <br>
        I bet you think about me when you're out<br>
        At your cool indie music concerts every week<br>
        I bet you think about me in your house<br>
        With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch<br>
        I bet you think about me when you say<br>
        "Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"<br>
        I bet you think about me<br>

        "Forever Winter (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"<br>
        <br>
        He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days<br>
        He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"<br>
        He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be<br>
        He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity<br>
        I call, just checking up on him<br>
        He's up, 3 A.M., pacing<br>
        He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"<br>
        My voice comes out begging<br>
        <br>
        All this time I didn't know<br>
        You were breaking down<br>
        I'd fall to pieces on the floor<br>
        If you weren't around<br>
        Too young to know it gets better<br>
        I'll be summer sun for you forever<br>
        Forever winter if you go<br>
        <br>
        He seems fine most of the time<br>
        Forcing smiles and never minds<br>
        His laugh is a symphony<br>
        When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe<br>
        I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head<br>
        Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead<br>
        I call, just checking up on him<br>
        He's up, 5 A.M., wasted<br>
        Long gone, not even listening<br>
        My voice comes out screaming<br>
        <br>
        All this time I didn't know<br>
        You were breaking down<br>
        I'd fall to pieces on the floor<br>
        If you weren't around<br>
        Too young to know it gets better<br>
        I'll be summer sun for you forever<br>
        Forever winter if you go<br>
        <br>
        If I was standing there in your apartment<br>
        I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it<br>
        I'd say I love you even at your darkest and<br>
        Please don't go<br>
        <br>
        I didn't know<br>
        You were breaking down<br>
        I'd fall to pieces on the floor<br>
        If you weren’t around<br>
        Too young to know it gets better<br>
        I'll be summer sun for you forever<br>
        Forever winter if you go<br>
        <br>
        I'll be your summer sun forever<br>
        At 3 A.M., pacing<br>
        All this time I didn't know<br>
        At 5 A.M., wasted<br>
        I'd be in pieces on the floor<br>
        Forever winter if you go<br>
        <br>
        He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days<br>
        I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"<br>

        "Run (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"<br>
        (feat. Ed Sheeran)<br>
        <br>
        One, two, three, four<br>
        <br>
        Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around<br>
        We shouldn't be in this town<br>
        And my so-called friends, they don't know<br>
        I'd drive away before I let you go<br>
        So give me a reason and don't say no, no<br>
        There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote<br>
        "I'll wait for you"<br>
        There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame<br>
        Take it with you<br>
        <br>
        And run, like you'd run from the law<br>
        Darling, let's run<br>
        Run from it all<br>
        We can go where our eyes can take us<br>
        Go where no one else is, run<br>
        Ooh, we'll run<br>
        Ooh, we'll run<br>
        Ooh, we'll run<br>
        <br>
        So you laugh like a child<br>
        And I'll sing like no one cares<br>
        No one to be, no one to tell<br>
        I could see this view a hundred times<br>
        Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes<br>
        So give me a reason and don't say no, no<br>
        And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket<br>
        Since I gave it to you<br>
        There's a heart on your sleeve<br>
        I'll take it when I leave<br>
        And hold it for you<br>
        <br>
        And run, like you'd run from the law<br>
        Darling, let's run<br>
        Run from it all<br>
        We can go like they're trying to chase us<br>
        Go where no one else is, run<br>
        Ooh, we'll run<br>
        Ooh, we'll run<br>
        Ooh, we'll run<br>
        <br>
        There's been this hole in my heart<br>
        This thing was a shot in the dark<br>
        Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart<br>
        And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        <br>
        Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)<br>
        Ooh, and we'll run<br>

        "The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"<br>
        <br>
        I wish I could fly<br>
        I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time<br>
        I'd write this in the sky<br>
        I miss you like it was the very first night<br>
        <br>
        And so it goes<br>
        Every weekend, this same party<br>
        I never go alone and I don't seem brokenhearted<br>
        My friends all say they know everything I'm going through<br>
        I drive down different roads<br>
        But they all lead back to you<br>
        'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel<br>
        They weren't riding in the car when we both fell<br>
        Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture<br>
        They don't know how much I miss you<br>
        <br>
        I wish I could fly<br>
        I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time<br>
        I'd write this in the sky<br>
        I miss you like it was the very first night<br>
        <br>
        And so it was<br>
        We never saw it coming<br>
        Not trying to fall in love<br>
        But we did like children running<br>
        Back then we didn't know we were built to fall apart<br>
        We broke the status quo, then we broke each other's hearts<br>
        But don't forget about the night out in LA<br>
        Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway<br>
        No one knows about the words that we whispered<br>
        No one knows how much I miss you<br>
        <br>
        I wish I could fly<br>
        I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time<br>
        I'd write this in the sky<br>
        I miss you like it was the very first night<br>
        <br>
        Take me away, take me away<br>
        Take me away to you, to you<br>
        Take me away, take me away<br>
        Take me away to you, to you<br>
        <br>
        I remember the night at the hotel<br>
        I was riding in the car when we both fell<br>
        I'm the one on the phone as you whisper<br>
        "Do you know how much I miss you?"<br>
        I wish that we could go back in time<br>
        And I'd say to you<br>
        "I miss you like it was the very first night"<br>
        <br>
        I wish I could fly<br>
        I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time<br>
        I'd write this in the sky<br>
        I miss you like it was the very first night<br>
        Take me away, take me away<br>
        Take me away to you, to you<br>
        Take me away, take me away<br>
        Take me away to you, to you<br>
        <br>

        "All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"<br>
        <br>
        I walked through the door with you, the air was cold<br>
        But something 'bout it felt like home somehow<br>
        And I left my scarf there at your sister's house<br>
        And you've still got it in your drawer, even now<br>
        Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze<br>
        We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate<br>
        Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place<br>
        And I can picture it after all these days<br>
        <br>
        And I know it's long gone and<br>
        That magic's not here no more<br>
        And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        'Cause there we are again on that little town street<br>
        You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me<br>
        Wind in my hair, I was there<br>
        I remember it all too well<br>
        <br>
        Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red<br>
        You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed<br>
        And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team<br>
        You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me<br>
        And you were tossing me the car keys, "fuck the patriarchy"<br>
        Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town<br>
        And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now<br>
        He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was<br>
        'Til we were dead and gone and buried<br>
        Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same<br>
        After three months in the grave<br>
        And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you<br>
        But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame<br>
        <br>
        And I know it's long gone and<br>
        There was nothing else I could do<br>
        And I forget about you long enough<br>
        To forget why I needed to<br>
        <br>
        'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night<br>
        We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light<br>
        Down the stairs, I was there<br>
        I remember it all too well<br>
        And there we are again when nobody had to know<br>
        You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath<br>
        Sacred prayer and we'd swear<br>
        To remember it all too well, yeah<br>
        <br>
        Well, maybe we got lost in translation<br>
        Maybe I asked for too much<br>
        But maybe this thing was a masterpiece<br>
        'Til you tore it all up<br>
        Running scared, I was there<br>
        I remember it all too well<br>
        And you call me up again just to break me like a promise<br>
        So casually cruel in the name of being honest<br>
        I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here<br>
        'Cause I remember it all, all, all<br>
        <br>
        They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell<br>
        Every time you double-cross my mind<br>
        You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine<br>
        And that made me want to die<br>
        The idea you had of me, who was she?<br>
        A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you<br>
        Not weeping in a party bathroom<br>
        Some actress asking me what happened, you<br>
        That's what happened, you<br>
        You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes<br>
        Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show<br>
        But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come<br>
        And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"<br>
        <br>
        Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it<br>
        I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it<br>
        After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own<br>
        Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone<br>
        But you keep my old scarf from that very first week<br>
        'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me<br>
        You can't get rid of it<br>
        'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah<br>
        'Cause there we are again when I loved you so<br>
        Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known<br>
        <br>
        It was rare, I was there<br>
        I remember it all too well<br>
        Wind in my hair, you were there<br>
        You remember it all<br>
        Down the stairs, you were there<br>
        You remember it all<br>
        It was rare, I was there<br>
        I remember it all too well<br>
        <br>
        And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes<br>
        "I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"<br>
        From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones<br>
        I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight<br>
        And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?<br>
        Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?<br>
        'Cause in this city's barren cold<br>
        I still remember the first fall of snow<br>
        And how it glistened as it fell<br>
        I remember it all too well<br>
        <br>
        Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?<br>
        Just between us, do you remember it all too well?<br>
        Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well<br>
        Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there<br>
        Down the stairs, I was there, I was there<br>
        Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there<br>
        It was rare, you remember it all too well<br>
        Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there<br>
        Down the stairs, I was there, I was there<br>
        Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there<br>
        It was rare, you remember it<br>
        Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there<br>
        Down the stairs, I was there, I was there<br>
        Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there<br>
        It was rare, you remember it<br>
        Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there<br>
        Down the stairs, I was there, I was there<br>
        Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there<br>
        It was rare, you remember it<br>
