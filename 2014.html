        "Welcome To New York (Taylor’s Version)"<br>
        <br>
        Walking through a crowd<br>
        The village is aglow<br>
        Kaleidoscope of loud<br>
        Heartbeats under coats<br>
        Everybody here<br>
        Wanted something more<br>
        Searching for a sound we hadn't<br>
        Heard before<br>
        And it said<br>
        <br>
        Welcome to New York<br>
        It's been waiting for you<br>
        Welcome to New York<br>

        <br>
        It's a new soundtrack<br>
        I could dance to this beat, beat<br>
        Forevermore<br>
        The lights are so bright<br>
        But they never blind me, me<br>

        Welcome to New York<br>
        Welcome to New York<br>
        <br>
        When we first dropped our bags on<br>
        Apartment floors<br>
        Took our broken hearts<br>
        Put them in a drawer<br>
        Everybody here was someone else<br>
        Before<br>
        And you can want who you want<br>
        Boys and boys and<br>
        Girls and girls<br>

        It's ever-changing<br>
        Like any true love<br>

        It drives you crazy<br>

        "Blank Space (Taylor’s Version)"<br>
        <br>
        Nice to meet you, where you been?<br>
        I could show you incredible things<br>
        Magic, madness, heaven, sin<br>
        Saw you there, and I thought<br>
        "Oh my God, look at that face<br>
        You look like my next mistake<br>
        Love's a game, wanna play?"<br>
        Ayy<br>
        <br>
        New money, suit and tie<br>
        I can read you like a magazine<br>
        Ain't it funny? Rumors fly<br>
        And I know you heard about me<br>
        So hey, let's be friends<br>
        I'm dying to see how this one ends<br>
        Grab your passport and my hand<br>
        I can make the bad guys good for a weekend<br>
        <br>
        So it's gonna be forever<br>
        Or it's gonna go down in flames<br>
        You can tell me when it's over, mm<br>
        If the high was worth the pain<br>
        Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
        They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
        'Cause you know I love the players<br>
        And you love the game<br>
        <br>
        'Cause we're young and we're reckless<br>
        We'll take this way too far<br>
        It'll leave you breathless, hmm<br>
        Or with a nasty scar<br>
        Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
        They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
        But I've got a blank space, baby<br>
        And I'll write your name<br>
        <br>
        Cherry lips, crystal skies<br>
        I could show you incredible things<br>
        Stolen kisses, pretty lies<br>
        You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen<br>
        Find out what you want<br>
        Be that girl for a month<br>
        Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no<br>
        <br>
        Screaming, crying, perfect storms<br>
        I can make all the tables turn<br>
        Rose garden filled with thorns<br>
        Keep you second guessing like<br>
        "Oh my God, who is she?"<br>
        I get drunk on jealousy<br>
        But you'll come back each time you leave<br>
        'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream<br>
        <br>
        So it's gonna be forever<br>
        Or it's gonna go down in flames<br>
        You can tell me when it's over, mm<br>

        But I've got a blank space, baby<br>
        And I'll write your name<br>
        <br>
        Boys only want love if it's torture<br>
        Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya<br>
        Boys only want love if it's torture<br>
        Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya<br>
        <br>
        So it's gonna be forever<br>
        Or it's gonna go down in flames<br>

        "Style (Taylor’s Version)"<br>
        <br>
        Midnight<br>
        You come and pick me up, no headlights<br>
        Long drive<br>
        Could end in burning flames or paradise<br>
        Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)<br>
        <br>
        I should just tell you to leave 'cause I<br>
        Know exactly where it leads but I<br>
        Watch us go 'round and 'round each time<br>
        <br>
        You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br>
        And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br>
        And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
        'Cause we never go out of style<br>
        We never go out of style<br>
        <br>
        You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt<br>
        And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt<br>
        And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
        'Cause we never go out of style<br>
        We never go out of style<br>
        <br>
        So it goes<br>
        He can't keep his wild eyes on the road<br>
        Takes me home<br>
        Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah<br>
        I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."<br>
        <br>
        He says, "What you've heard is true but I<br>
        Can't stop thinking about you," and I<br>
        I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."<br>
        <br>
        'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br>
        And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br>
        And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
        'Cause we never go out of style<br>
        We never go out of style<br>

        You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt<br>
        And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)<br>
        And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
        'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)<br>
        We never go out of style<br>
        <br>
        Take me home<br>

        "Out Of The Woods (Taylor’s Version)"<br>
        <br>
        Looking at it now<br>
        It all seems so simple<br>
        We were lying on your couch<br>
        I remember<br>
        You took a Polaroid of us<br>
        Then discovered (then discovered)<br>
        The rest of the world was black and white<br>
        But we were in screaming color<br>
        And I remember thinking<br>
        <br>
        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
        Are we out of the woods?<br>
        Are we in the clear yet?<br>
        Are we in the clear yet?<br>

        In the clear yet? Good<br>
        Are we out of the woods?<br>
        <br>
        Looking at it now<br>
        Last December (last December)<br>
        We were built to fall apart<br>
        Then fall back together (back together)<br>
        Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck<br>
        The night we couldn't quite forget<br>
        When we decided (we decided)<br>
        To move the furniture so we could dance<br>
        Baby, like we stood a chance<br>
        Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying<br>
        And I remember thinkin'<br>
        <br>
        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>

        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
        Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
        Oh<br>
        Are we out of the woods?<br>
        Are we in the clear yet?<br>
        Are we in the clear yet?<br>
        Are we in the clear yet?<br>
        In the clear yet? Good<br>
        Are we out of the woods?<br>
        <br>
        Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?<br>
        Twenty stitches in a hospital room<br>
        When you started cryin', baby, I did, too<br>
        But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you<br>
        Remember when we couldn't take the heat<br>
        I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"<br>
        But the monsters turned out to be just trees<br>
        When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me<br>
        <br>
        You were lookin' at me<br>
        You were lookin' at me<br>

        And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed<br>
        The more I think about it now the less I know<br>
        All I know is that you drove us off the road<br>
        <br>
        Stay<br>
        Hey, all you had to do was stay<br>
        Had me in the palm of your hand<br>
        Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?<br>
        Stay<br>

        It's 2 AM in your car<br>
        Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start<br>
        You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead<br>
        You're thinking that I hate you now<br>
        'Cause you still don't know what I never said<br>
        <br>
        I wish you would come back<br>
        Wish I never hung up the phone like I did<br>

        It's 2 AM in my room<br>
        Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you<br>
        We're a crooked love in a straight line down<br>
        Makes you wanna run and hide<br>
        But it makes you turn right back around<br>
        <br>
        I wish you would come back<br>

        <br>
        You always knew how to push my buttons<br>
        You give me everything and nothing<br>
        This mad mad love makes you come running<br>
        To stand back where you stood<br>
        I wish you would, I wish you would<br>
        (I wish you would, I wish you would)<br>

        2 AM, here we are<br>
        See your face, hear my voice in the dark<br>
        We're a crooked love in a straight line down<br>
        Makes you wanna run and hide<br>
        But it made us turn right back around<br>

        When you left her all alone<br>
        And never told her why, why<br>

        Clear blue water<br>
        High tide came and brought you in<br>
        And I could go on and on, on and on and I will<br>
        Skies grew darker<br>
        Currents swept you out again<br>
        And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone<br>
        <br>
        In silent screams and wildest dreams<br>
        I never dreamed of this<br>
        <br>
        This love is good, this love is bad<br>
        This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh<br>
        These hands had to let it go free, and<br>
        This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh<br>
        Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        Tossing, turning<br>
        Struggled through the night with someone new<br>
        And I could go on and on, on and on<br>
        Lantern, burning<br>
        Flickered in my mind, only you<br>
        But you were still gone, gone, gone<br>
        <br>
        Been losing grip, on sinking ships<br>
        You showed up just in time<br>

        This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh<br>

        It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight<br>
        I can hear them whisper as we pass by<br>
        It's a bad sign, bad sign<br>
        Something happens when everybody finds out<br>
        See the vultures circling dark clouds<br>

        The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)<br>
        When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst<br>
        It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)<br>
        You're still all over me<br>
        Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore<br>
        <br>
        Hung my head as I lost the war<br>
        And the sky turned black like a perfect storm<br>
        <br>
        Rain came pouring down<br>
        When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe<br>
        And by morning<br>
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean<br>
        (Oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
        <br>
        There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)<br>
        When the butterflies turned to<br>
        Dust that covered my whole room<br>
        So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)<br>
        Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you<br>
        <br>
        The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud<br>
        But no one heard a thing<br>
        <br>
        Rain came pouring down<br>
        When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe<br>

        Ten months sober, I must admit<br>
        Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it<br>

        Took a wrong turn and we<br>
        Fell down a rabbit hole<br>

        'Cause nothing's as it seems<br>
        And spinning out of control<br>

        Strange look on his face<br>
        Pauses, then says<br>

        Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
        Come on, come along with me<br>
        Heartbreak is the national anthem<br>
        We sing it proudly<br>
        We are too busy dancing<br>
        To get knocked off our feet<br>
        Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
        The best people in life are free<br>
        <br>
        We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding<br>
        We hang back, it's all in the timing<br>
        It's poker, he can't see it in my face<br>
        But I'm about to play my Ace<br>
        <br>
        We need love, but all we want is danger<br>
        We team up then switch sides like a record changer<br>
        The rumors are terrible and cruel<br>
        But, honey, most of them are true<br>
        <br>
        'Cause baby, I could build a castle<br>
        Out of all the bricks they threw at me<br>
        And every day is like a battle<br>
        But every night with us is like a dream<br>
        <br>
        Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
        Come on, come along with me<br>
        Heartbreak is the national anthem<br>
        We sing it proudly<br>
        We are too busy dancing<br>
        To get knocked off our feet<br>
        Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
        The best people in life are free<br>
        <br>
        So come on, come along with me<br>
        The best people in life are free<br>
        <br>
        Please take my hand and<br>
        Please take me dancing and<br>
        Please leave me stranded<br>
        It's so romantic (it's so romantic)<br>
        (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)<br>
        <br>
        Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle<br>
        Out of all the bricks they threw at me<br>
        And every day is like a battle<br>
        But every night with us is like a dream<br>
        <br>
        'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)<br>
        Out of all the bricks they threw at me<br>
        And every day is like a battle<br>
        But every night with us is like a dream<br>
        <br>
        Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
        Come on, come along with me<br>
        Heartbreak is the national anthem<br>
        We sing it proudly<br>
        We are too busy dancing<br>

        “”Slut!” (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”<br>
        <br>
        Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard<br>
        Clink, clink, being this young is art<br>
        Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool<br>
        What if all I need is you?<br>
        <br>
        Got love-struck, went straight to my head<br>
        Got lovesick all over my bed<br>
        Love to think you'll never forget<br>
        Handprints in wet cement<br>
        Adorned with smoke on my clothes<br>
        Lovelorn and nobody knows<br>
        Love thorns all over this rose<br>
        I'll pay the price, you won't<br>
        <br>
        But if I'm all dressed up<br>
        They might as well be lookin' at us<br>
        And if they call me a slut<br>
        You know it might be worth it for once<br>
        And if I'm gonna be drunk<br>
        I might as well be drunk in love<br>
        <br>
        Send the code, he's waitin' there<br>
        The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air<br>
        Everyone wants him, that was my crime<br>
        The wrong place at the right time<br>
        And I break down, then he's pullin' me in<br>
        In a world of boys, he's a gentleman<br>
        <br>
        Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)<br>
        Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)<br>
        Love to think you'll never forget<br>
        We'll pay the price, I guess<br>
        <br>
        But if I'm all dressed up (If I'm all dressed up)<br>
        They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)<br>
        And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)<br>
        You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)<br>
        And if I'm gonna be drunk<br>
        I might as well be drunk in love<br>
        <br>
        Half asleep, takin' your time<br>
        In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury<br>
        You're not sayin' you're in love with me<br>
        But you're going to<br>
        Half awake, takin' your chances<br>
        It's a big mistake, I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"<br>
        I'm not saying, "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)<br>
        But you're going to<br>
        <br>
        (Up)<br>
        And if they call me a (Slut)<br>
        You know it might be worth it for once<br>
        And if I'm gonna be (Drunk)<br>
        I might as well be drunk in love<br>

        “Say Don’t Go (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”<br>
        <br>
        I've known it from the very start<br>
        We're a shot in the darkest dark<br>
        Oh no, oh no<br>
        I'm unarmed<br>
        The waiting is a sadness<br>
        Fading into madness<br>
        Oh no, oh no<br>
        It won't stop<br>
        <br>
        I'm standing on a tightrope, alone<br>
        I hold my breath a little bit longer<br>
        Halfway out the door, but it won't close<br>
        I'm holding out hope for you to say, "Don't go"<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to lead me on?<br>
        Why'd you have to twist the knife?<br>
        Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding<br>
        Why'd you whisper in the dark<br>
        Just to leave me in the night?<br>
        Now your silence has me screaming, screaming<br>
        Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        Say, say, say, say<br>
        <br>
        Now I'm pacing on shaky ground<br>
        Strike a match, then you blow it out<br>
        Oh no, oh no<br>
        It's not fair<br>
        'Cause you kiss me and it stops time<br>
        And I'm yours, but you're not mine<br>
        Oh no, oh no<br>
        You're not there<br>
        <br>
        I'm standing on the sidewalk, alone<br>
        I wait for you to drive by<br>
        I was trying to see the cards that you won't show<br>
        I'm about to fold unless you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        Oh-ah<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to lead me on?<br>
        Why'd you have to twist the knife?<br>
        Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding<br>
        Why'd you whisper in the dark<br>
        Just to leave me in the night?<br>
        Now your silence has me screaming, screaming<br>
        Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        Say, say, say, say<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to make me want you? (Why'd you have to make me want you?)<br>
        Why'd you have to give me nothing back? (Why'd you have to)<br>
        Why'd you have to make me love you? (Why'd you have to make me love you?)<br>
        I said, "I love you," you say nothing back (I said, "I love you")<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to lead me on?<br>
        Why'd you have to twist the knife?<br>
        Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding<br>
        Why'd you whisper in the dark<br>
        Just to leave me in the night?<br>
        Now your silence has me screaming, screaming<br>
        Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        Say, say, say, say<br>
        <br>
        But you won't<br>
        But you won't<br>
        But you won't<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"<br>
        But you won't<br>
        But you won't<br>
        But you won't<br>

        “Now That We Don’t Talk (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”<br>
        <br>
        You went to a party, I heard from everybody<br>
        You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started<br>
        Did you get anxious though, on the way home?<br>
        I guess I'll never, ever know<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        You grew your hair long, you got new icons<br>
        And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on<br>
        I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change<br>
        But I guess I don't have a say<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        I called my mom, she said that it was for the best<br>
        Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less<br>
        I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost<br>
        And what it cost<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        What do you tell your friends we<br>
        Shared dinners, long weekends with?<br>
        Truth is, I can't pretend it's<br>
        Platonic, it's just ended, so<br>
        <br>
        I called my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)<br>
        Remind myself the way you faded till I left (Till I left)<br>
        I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (What I lost)<br>
        And what it cost<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        I don't have to pretend I like acid rock<br>
        Or that I'd like to be on a mega-yacht<br>
        With important men who think important thoughts<br>
        Guess maybe I am better off<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        And the only way back to my dignity<br>
        Was to turn into a shrouded mystery<br>
        Just like I had been when you were chasing me<br>
        Guess this is how it has to be<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>

        “Suburban Legends (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”<br>
        <br>
        You had people who called you on unmarked numbers<br>
        In my peripheral vision<br>
        I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer<br>
        All was quickly forgiven<br>
        You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious<br>
        Flush with the currency of cool<br>
        I was always turning out my empty pockets<br>
        And when it came to you<br>
        <br>
        I didn't come here to make friends<br>
        We were born to be suburban legends<br>
        When you hold me, it holds me together<br>
        And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever<br>
        <br>
        I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs<br>
        Would surprise the whole school<br>
        When I ended up back at our class reunion<br>
        Walking in with you<br>
        You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries<br>
        With the pages ripped out<br>
        I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium<br>
        And I can still see you now<br>
        <br>
        I didn't come here to make friends<br>
        We were born to be suburban legends<br>
        When you hold me, it holds me together<br>
        And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever<br>
        <br>
        I know that you still remember<br>
        We were born to be national treasures<br>
        When you told me we'd get back together<br>
        And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever<br>
        <br>
        Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block<br>
        I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it<br>
        Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door<br>
        You don't knock anymore, and my whole life's ruined<br>
        <br>
        Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block<br>
        I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it<br>
        Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door<br>
        You don't knock anymore, and I always knew it<br>
        And my life had been ruined<br>

        “Is It Over Now? (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”<br>
        <br>
        Once the flight had flown<br>
        With the wilt of the rose<br>
        I slept all alone<br>
        You still wouldn't go<br>
        <br>
        Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later<br>
        I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters<br>
        You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor<br>
        You search in every maiden's bed for something greater<br>
        <br>
        Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?<br>
        Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?<br>
        "Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out<br>
        Baby, was it over then?<br>
        And is it over now?<br>
        <br>
        When you lost control<br>
        Red blood, white snow<br>
        Blue dress on a boat<br>
        Your new girl is my clone<br>
        <br>
        And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights<br>
        At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight<br>
        Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs<br>
        Oh Lord, I think about jumping<br>
        Off of very tall somethings<br>
        Just to see you come running<br>
        And say the one thing I've been wanting<br>
        But no!<br>
        <br>
        Let's fast forward to 300 awkward blind dates later<br>
        If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her<br>
        You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor<br>
        You search in every model's bed for something greater<br>
        <br>
        Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?<br>
        Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?<br>
