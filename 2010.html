        <h3>“Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” (released July 7, 2023) (original version released October 25, 2010)</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>"Mine (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        Ah-ah, ah-ah<br>
        Ah-ah, ah-ah<br>
        <br>
        You were in college working part-time, waitin' tables<br>
        Left a small town, never looked back<br>
        I was a flight risk with a fear of falling<br>
        Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts<br>
        <br>
        I say, "Can you believe it?"<br>
        As we're lyin' on the couch<br>
        The moment I could see it<br>
        Yes, yes, I can see it now<br>
        <br>
        Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?<br>
        You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
        You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
        <br>
        Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together<br>
        And there's a drawer of my things at your place<br>
        You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded<br>
        You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes<br>
        <br>
        But we got bills to pay<br>
        We got nothing figured out<br>
        When it was hard to take<br>
        Yes, yes, this is what I thought about<br>
        <br>
        Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?<br>
        You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
        You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
        Do you remember all the city lights on the water?<br>
        You saw me start to believe for the first time<br>
        You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
        <br>
        Oh-oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        And I remember that fight, 2:30AM<br>
        As everything was slippin' right out of our hands<br>
        I ran out cryin' and you followed me out into the street<br>
        Braced myself for the goodbye<br>
        'Cause that's all I've ever known<br>
        Then you took me by surprise<br>
        You said, "I'll never leave you alone"<br>
        <br>
        You said, "I remember how it felt sitting by the water<br>
        And every time I look at you, it's like the first time<br>
        I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        She is the best thing that's ever been mine"<br>
        <br>
        Hold on and make it last<br>
        Hold on, never turn back<br>
        (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
        <br>
        Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)<br>
        Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on, yeah)<br>
        Yes, yes, and I can see it (Hold on)<br>
        Yes, yes, I can see it now (See it now, see it now)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Sparks Fly (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        The way you move is like a full on rainstorm<br>
        And I'm a house of cards<br>
        You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'<br>
        But I kinda know that I won't get far<br>
        And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch<br>
        Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of<br>
        <br>
        Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain<br>
        Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain<br>
        'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
        Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down<br>
        Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around<br>
        'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
        <br>
        My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea<br>
        You touch me once and it's really somethin'<br>
        You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be<br>
        I'm on my guard for the rest of the world<br>
        But with you, I know it's no good<br>
        And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would<br>
        <br>
        Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain<br>
        Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain<br>
        'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
        Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down<br>
        Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around<br>
        'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
        <br>
        I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild<br>
        Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me<br>
        It's just wrong enough to make it feel right<br>
        And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?<br>
        I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show<br>
        <br>
        Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain<br>
        Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain<br>
        'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
        Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down<br>
        Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around<br>
        'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
        <br>
        And the sparks fly<br>
        Oh, baby, smile<br>
        And the sparks fly<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Back To December (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        I'm so glad you made time to see me<br>
        How's life? Tell me, how's your family?<br>
        I haven't seen them in a while<br>
        You've been good, busier than ever<br>
        We small talk, work and the weather<br>
        Your guard is up and I know why<br>
        <br>
        Because the last time you saw me<br>
        Is still burned in the back of your mind<br>
        You gave me roses and I left them there to die<br>
        <br>
        So, this is me swallowing my pride<br>
        Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"<br>
        And I go back to December all the time<br>
        It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you<br>
        Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
        I go back to December, turn around and make it alright<br>
        I go back to December all the time<br>
        <br>
        These days, I haven't been sleeping<br>
        Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'<br>
        When your birthday passed and I didn't call<br>
        Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times<br>
        I watched you laughin' from the passenger side<br>
        And realized I loved you in the fall<br>
        <br>
        And then the cold came, the dark days<br>
        When fear crept into my mind<br>
        You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye<br>
        <br>
        So, this is me swallowing my pride<br>
        Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"<br>
        And I go back to December all the time<br>
        It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you<br>
        Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
        I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind<br>
        I go back to December all the time<br>
        <br>
        I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile<br>
        So good to me, so right<br>
        And how you held me in your arms that September night<br>
        The first time you ever saw me cry<br>
        Maybe this is wishful thinkin'<br>
        Probably mindless dreaming<br>
        But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right<br>
        I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't<br>
        So, if the chain is on your door, I understand<br>
        <br>
        But this is me swallowing my pride<br>
        Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"<br>
        And I go back to December<br>
        It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you<br>
        Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
        I go back to December, turn around and make it alright<br>
        I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind<br>
        I go back to December all the time<br>
        <br>
        All the time<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        I am not the kind of girl<br>
        Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion<br>
        But you are not the kind of boy<br>
        Who should be marrying the wrong girl<br>
        I sneak in and see your friends<br>
        And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel<br>
        And she is yelling at a bridesmaid<br>
        Somewhere back inside a room<br>
        Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry<br>
        <br>
        This is surely not what you thought it would be<br>
        I lose myself in a daydream<br>
        Where I stand and say<br>
        <br>
        Don't say yes, run away now<br>
        I'll meet you when you're out<br>
        Of the church, at the back door<br>
        Don't wait or say a single vow<br>
        You need to hear me out<br>
        And they said, "Speak now"<br>
        <br>
        Fond gestures are exchanged<br>
        And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march<br>
        And I am hiding in the curtains<br>
        It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be<br>
        <br>
        She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen<br>
        But I know you wish it was me<br>
        You wish it was me, don't you?<br>
        <br>
        Don't say yes, run away now<br>
        I'll meet you when you're out<br>
        Of the church, at the back door<br>
        Don't wait or say a single vow<br>
        You need to hear me out<br>
        And they said, "Speak now"<br>
        Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)<br>
        I'll meet you when you're out<br>
        Of the church, at the back door<br>
        Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)<br>
        Your time is running out<br>
        And they said, "Speak now"<br>
        <br>
        Ooh (Run away now), la<br>
        Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh<br>
        <br>
        I hear the preacher say<br>
        "Speak now or forever hold your peace"<br>
        There's the silence, there's my last chance<br>
        I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me<br>
        Horrified looks from everyone in the room<br>
        But I'm only lookin' at you<br>
        <br>
        I am not the kind of girl<br>
        Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion<br>
        But you are not the kind of boy<br>
        Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha<br>
        <br>
        So, don't say yes, run away now<br>
        I'll meet you when you're out<br>
        Of the church, at the back door<br>
        Don't wait or say a single vow<br>
        You need to hear me out<br>
        They said, "Speak now"<br>
        And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)<br>
        I'll meet you when I'm out<br>
        Of my tux, at the back door<br>
        Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)<br>
        So glad you were around<br>
        When they said, 'Speak now'"<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Dear John (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        Long were the nights<br>
        When my days once revolved around you<br>
        Counting my footsteps<br>
        Prayin' the floor won't fall through again<br>
        And my mother accused me of losin' my mind<br>
        But I swore I was fine<br>
        You paint me a blue sky<br>
        Then go back to turn it to rain<br>
        And I lived in your chess game<br>
        But you change the rules every day<br>
        Wonderin' which version of you<br>
        I might get on the phone tonight<br>
        Well, I stopped pickin' up<br>
        And this song is to let you know why<br>
        <br>
        Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone<br>
        Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
        The girl in the dress cried the whole way home<br>
        I shoulda known<br>
        <br>
        Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame<br>
        Or maybe it's you and your sick need<br>
        To give love and take it away<br>
        And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors<br>
        Who don't understand<br>
        And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said<br>
        "Run as fast as you can"<br>
        <br>
        Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone<br>
        Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
        The girl in the dress cried the whole way home<br>
        Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong<br>
        Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by<br>
        Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?<br>
        I shoulda known<br>
        <br>
        You are an expert at "Sorry" and keepin' lines blurry<br>
        Never impressed by me acing your tests<br>
        All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes<br>
        'Cause you burned them out<br>
        But I took your matches before fire could catch me<br>
        So don't look now<br>
        I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town<br>
        Oh<br>
        <br>
        Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone<br>
        Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
        The girl in the dress cried the whole way home<br>
        I see it all now that you're gone<br>
        Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
        The girl in the dress wrote you a song<br>
        You shoulda known<br>
        <br>
        You shoulda known<br>
        Don't you think I was too young?<br>
        You shoulda known<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Mean (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        You, with your words like knives<br>
        And swords and weapons that you use against me<br>
        You have knocked me off my feet again<br>
        Got me feeling like I'm nothing<br>
        You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard<br>
        Calling me out when I'm wounded<br>
        You, pickin' on the weaker man<br>
        <br>
        Well, you can take me down<br>
        With just one single blow<br>
        But you don't know what you don't know<br>
        <br>
        Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Why you gotta be so mean?<br>
        <br>
        You, with your switching sides<br>
        And your wildfire lies and your humiliation<br>
        You have pointed out my flaws again<br>
        As if I don't already see them<br>
        I walk with my head down, trying to block you out<br>
        'Cause I'll never impress you<br>
        I just wanna feel okay again<br>
        <br>
        I bet you got pushed around<br>
        Somebody made you cold<br>
        But the cycle ends right now<br>
        'Cause you can't lead me down that road<br>
        And you don't know what you don't know<br>
        <br>
        Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Why you gotta be so mean?<br>
        <br>
        And I can see you years from now in a bar<br>
        Talking over a football game<br>
        With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening<br>
        Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things<br>
        Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing<br>
        But all you are is mean<br>
        <br>
        All you are is mean<br>
        And a liar, and pathetic<br>
        And alone in life, and mean<br>
        And mean, and mean, and mean<br>
        <br>
        But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah<br>
        Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Why you gotta be so mean?<br>
        Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city<br>
        (Why you gotta be so mean?)<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        (Why you gotta be so mean?)<br>
        Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<br>
        (Why you gotta be so mean?)<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Why you gotta be so mean?<br>

        <h4>"The Story Of Us (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us<br>
        How we met and the sparks flew instantly<br>
        And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"<br>
        I used to know my place was the spot next to you<br>
        Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat<br>
        'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on<br>
        <br>
        Oh, a simple complication<br>
        Miscommunications lead to fallout<br>
        So many things that I wish you knew<br>
        So many walls up, I can't break through<br>
        <br>
        Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room<br>
        And we're not speakin'<br>
        And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you<br>
        Like it's killin' me? Yeah<br>
        I don't know what to say since the twist of fate<br>
        When it all broke down<br>
        And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now<br>
        <br>
        Next chapter<br>
        <br>
        How'd we end up this way?<br>
        See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy<br>
        And you're doin' your best to avoid me<br>
        I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us<br>
        How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here<br>
        But you held your pride like you should've held me<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I'm scared to see the ending<br>
        Why are we pretending this is nothin'?<br>
        I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how<br>
        I've never heard silence quite this loud<br>
        <br>
        Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room<br>
        And we're not speakin'<br>
        And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you<br>
        Like it's killin' me? Yeah<br>
        I don't know what to say since the twist of fate<br>
        When it all broke down<br>
        And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now<br>
        <br>
        This is looking like a contest<br>
        Of who can act like they care less<br>
        But I liked it better when you were on my side<br>
        The battle's in your hands now<br>
        But I would lay my armor down<br>
        If you said you'd rather love than fight<br>
        <br>
        So many things that you wish I knew<br>
        But the story of us might be ending soon<br>
        <br>
        Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room<br>
        And we're not speakin'<br>
        And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you<br>
        Like it's killin' me? Yeah<br>
        And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate<br>
        When it all broke down<br>
        And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now<br>
        And we're not speakin'<br>
        And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you<br>
        Like it's killin' me? Yeah<br>
        I don't know what to say since the twist of fate<br>
        'Cause we're goin' down<br>
        And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now<br>
        <br>
        The end<br>

        <h4>"Never Grow Up (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        Your little hand's wrapped around my finger<br>
        And it's so quiet in the world tonight<br>
        Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming<br>
        So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight<br>
        <br>
        To you, everything's funny<br>
        You got nothing to regret<br>
        I'd give all I have, honey<br>
        If you could stay like that<br>
        <br>
        Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up<br>
        Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little<br>
        Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up<br>
        Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple<br>
        I won't let nobody hurt you<br>
        Won't let no one break your heart<br>
        And no one will desert you<br>
        Just try to never grow up<br>
        <br>
        Never grow up<br>
        <br>
        You're in the car, on the way to the movies<br>
        And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off<br>
        At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do<br>
        And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots<br>
        <br>
        But don't make her drop you off around the block<br>
        Remember that she's gettin' older, too<br>
        And don't lose the way that you dance around<br>
        In your PJs getting ready for school<br>
        <br>
        Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up<br>
        Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little<br>
        Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up<br>
        Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple<br>
        No one's ever burned you<br>
        Nothing's ever left you scarred<br>
        And even though you want to<br>
        Just try to never grow up<br>
        <br>
        Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room<br>
        Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home<br>
        Remember the footsteps, remember the words said<br>
        And all your little brother's favorite songs<br>
        I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone<br>
        <br>
        So, here I am in my new apartment<br>
        In a big city, they just dropped me off<br>
        It's so much colder than I thought it would be<br>
        So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on<br>
        <br>
        Wish I'd never grown up<br>
        I wish I'd never grown up<br>
        Oh, I don't wanna grow up<br>
        Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little<br>
        Oh, I don't wanna grow up<br>
        Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple<br>
        Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up<br>
        Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little<br>
        Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up<br>
        Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple<br>
        I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)<br>
        Won't let no one break your heart<br>
        And even though you want to<br>
        Please, try to never grow up<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh (Never grow up)<br>
        Don't you ever grow up<br>
        Oh (Never grow up)<br>
        Just never grow up<br>

        <h4>"Enchanted (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        There I was again tonight<br>
        Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>
        Same old tired, lonely place<br>
        Walls of insincerity<br>
        Shifting eyes and vacancy<br>
        Vanished when I saw your face<br>
        All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br>
        <br>
        Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"<br>
        Across the room, your silhouette<br>
        Starts to make its way to me<br>
        The playful conversation starts<br>
        Counter all your quick remarks<br>
        Like passing notes in secrecy<br>
        And it was enchanting to meet you<br>
        All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you<br>
        <br>
        This night is sparklin', don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home<br>
        I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew<br>
        I was enchanted to meet you<br>
        <br>
        The lingering question kept me up<br>
        2AM, who do you love?<br>
        I wonder 'til I'm wide awake<br>
        And now, I'm pacing back and forth<br>
        Wishing you were at my door<br>
        I'd open up and you would say<br>
        "Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"<br>
        All I know is I was enchanted to meet you<br>
        <br>
        This night is sparklin', don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home<br>
        I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew<br>
        This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br>
        I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew<br>
        I was enchanted to meet you<br>
        <br>
        This is me praying that<br>
        This was the very first page<br>
        Not where the storyline ends<br>
        My thoughts will echo your name<br>
        Until I see you again<br>
        These are the words I held back<br>
        As I was leaving too soon<br>
        I was enchanted to meet you<br>
        Please, don't be in love with someone else<br>
        Please, don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
        Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)<br>
        Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Oh-oh)<br>
        <br>
        This night is sparklin', don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home<br>
        I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew<br>
        This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)<br>
        Don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)<br>
        Dancing around all alone<br>
        I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)<br>
        Wonderin' if you knew<br>
        I was enchanted to meet you<br>

        <h4>"Better Than Revenge (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did<br>
        Ha, time for a little revenge<br>
        <br>
        The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and<br>
        I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him<br>
        She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause<br>
        She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"<br>
        I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it<br>
        I underestimated just who I was dealing with<br>
        She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum<br>
        She underestimated just who she was stealing from<br>
        <br>
        She's not a saint and she's not what you think<br>
        She's an actress, woah<br>
        He was a moth to the flame<br>
        She was holding the matches, woah<br>
        Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys<br>
        On the playground won't make you many friends<br>
        She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind<br>
        There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha<br>
        <br>
        She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list<br>
        She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it<br>
        I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and<br>
        She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things<br>
        But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know<br>
        Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go<br>
        Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me<br>
        But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity<br>
        (Think about what you did)<br>
        <br>
        She's not a saint and she's not what you think<br>
        She's an actress, woah<br>
        He was a moth to the flame<br>
        She was holding the matches, woah<br>
        Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys<br>
        On the playground won't make you many friends<br>
        She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind<br>
        There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha<br>
        <br>
        I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey<br>
        You might have him, but haven't you heard?<br>
        I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey<br>
        You might have him, but I always get the last word<br>
        Woah, woah-ah-oh<br>
        <br>
        She's not a saint and she's not what you think<br>
        She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)<br>
        He was a moth to the flame<br>
        She was holding the matches, woah<br>
        Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys<br>
        On the playground won't make you many friends<br>
        She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind<br>
        There is nothing I do better than revenge<br>
        <br>
        Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?<br>
        'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)<br>
        Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)<br>
        I don't think you do, I don't think you do<br>
        Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)<br>
        Come on, show me how much better you are<br>
        (So much better, yeah?)<br>
        See, you deserve some applause<br>
        'Cause you're so much better<br>
        She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"<br>
        <br>

        <h4>"Innocent (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        I guess you really did it this time<br>
        Left yourself in your war path<br>
        Lost your balance on a tightrope<br>
        Lost your mind trying to get it back<br>
        <br>
        Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?<br>
        Always a bigger bed to crawl into<br>
        Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything<br>
        And everybody believed in you?<br>
        <br>
        It's alright, just wait and see<br>
        Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh<br>
        Who you are is not where you've been<br>
        You're still an innocent<br>
        You're still an innocent<br>
        <br>
        Did some things you can't speak of<br>
        But at night, you live it all again<br>
        You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now<br>
        If only you had seen what you know now then<br>
        <br>
        Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?<br>
        When everything out of reach<br>
        Someone bigger brought down to you<br>
        Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep<br>
        Before the monsters caught up to you?<br>
        <br>
        It's alright, just wait and see<br>
        Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh<br>
        Who you are is not where you've been<br>
        You're still an innocent<br>
        It's okay, and life is a tough crowd<br>
        Thirty-two and still growing up now<br>
        Who you are is not what you did<br>
        You're still an innocent<br>
        <br>
        Time turns flames to embers<br>
        You'll have new Septembers<br>
        Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh<br>
        Minds change like the weather<br>
        I hope you remember<br>
        Today is never too late to be brand new, oh<br>

        <h4>"Haunted (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        You and I walk a fragile line<br>
        I have known it all this time<br>
        But I never thought I'd live to see it break<br>
        It's getting dark and it's all too quiet<br>
        And I can't trust anything now<br>
        And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake<br>
        <br>
        Oh, holding my breath<br>
        Won't lose you again<br>
        Something's made your eyes go cold<br>
        <br>
        Come on, come on, don't leave me like this<br>
        I thought I had you figured out<br>
        Something's gone terribly wrong<br>
        You're all I wanted<br>
        Come on, come on, don't leave me like this<br>
        I thought I had you figured out<br>
        Can't breathe whenever you're gone<br>
        Can't turn back now, I'm haunted<br>
        <br>
        Stood there and watched you walk away<br>
        From everything we had<br>
        But I still mean every word I said to you<br>
        He will try to take away my pain<br>
        And he just might make me smile<br>
        But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead<br>
        <br>
        Oh, holding my breath<br>

        Come on, come on, don't leave me like this<br>
        I thought I had you figured out<br>
        Can't breathe whenever you're gone<br>
        I can't go back, I'm haunted<br>
        <br>
        Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
        You and I walk a fragile line<br>
        I have known it all this time<br>
        Never ever thought I'd see it break<br>
        Never thought I'd see it<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>"Last Kiss (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        I still remember the look on your face<br>
        Lit through the darkness at 1:58<br>
        The words that you whispered for just us to know<br>
        You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?<br>
        Away<br>
        <br>
        I do recall now, the smell of the rain<br>
        Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane<br>
        That July ninth, the beat of your heart<br>
        It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms<br>
        <br>
        But now I'll go<br>
        Sit on the floor wearing your clothes<br>
        All that I know is I don't know<br>
        How to be something you miss<br>
        <br>
        I never thought we'd have a last kiss<br>
        I never imagined we'd end like this<br>
        Your name, forever the name on my lips<br>
        <br>
        I do remember the swing of your step<br>
        The life of the party, you're showing off again<br>
        And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in<br>
        I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did<br>
        Because I love your handshake, meeting my father<br>
        I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets<br>
        How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something<br>
        There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions<br>
        <br>
        And I'll go<br>
        Sit on the floor wearing your clothes<br>
        All that I know is I don't know<br>
        How to be something you miss<br>
        <br>
        I never thought we'd have a last kiss<br>
        I never imagined we'd end like this<br>
        Your name, forever the name on my lips, mm-hmm<br>
        <br>
        So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep<br>
        And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe<br>
        And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are<br>
        Hope it's nice where you are<br>
        And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day<br>
        And something reminds you you wish you had stayed<br>
        You can plan for a change in the weather and time<br>
        But I never planned on you changing your mind<br>
        <br>
        So, I'll go<br>
        Sit on the floor wearing your clothes<br>
        All that I know is I don't know<br>
        How to be something you miss<br>
        <br>
        I never thought we'd have a last kiss<br>
        I never imagined we'd end like this<br>
        Your name, forever the name on my lips<br>
        <br>
        Just like our last kiss<br>
        Forever the name on my lips<br>
        Forever the name on my lips<br>
        Just like our last<br>

        <h4>"Long Live (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        I said, "Remember this moment"<br>
        In the back of my mind<br>
        The time we stood with our shaking hands<br>
        The crowds in stands went wild<br>
        We were the kings and the queens<br>
        And they read off our names<br>
        The night you danced like you knew our lives would<br>
        Never be the same<br>
        You held your head like a hero on a history book page<br>
        It was the end of a decade<br>
        But the start of an age<br>
        <br>
        Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
        How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
        I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"<br>
        And bring on all the pretenders<br>
        One day, we will be remembered<br>
        <br>
        I said, "Remember this feeling"<br>
        I pass the pictures around<br>
        Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines<br>
        Wishing for right now<br>
        We are the kings and the queens<br>
        You traded your baseball cap for a crown<br>
        When they gave us our trophies<br>
        And we held them up for our town<br>
        And the cynics were outraged<br>
        Screaming, "This is absurd"<br>
        'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans<br>
        Got to rule the world<br>
        <br>
        Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
        How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
        I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"<br>
        And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid<br>
        Long live all the mountains we moved<br>
        I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you<br>
        I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"<br>
        And bring on all the pretenders<br>
        One day, we will be remembered<br>
        <br>
        Hold on to spinning around<br>
        Confetti falls to the ground<br>
        May these memories break our fall<br>
        Will you take a moment? Promise me this<br>
        That you'll stand by me forever<br>
        But if, God forbid, fate should step in<br>
        And force us into a goodbye<br>
        If you have children some day<br>
        When they point to the pictures<br>
        Please tell 'em my name<br>
        Tell 'em how the crowds went wild<br>
        Tell 'em how I hope they shine<br>
        Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
        I had the time of my life with you<br>
        <br>
        Long, long live the walls we crashed through<br>
        How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
        And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"<br>
        And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid<br>
        Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"<br>
        I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you<br>
        And long, long live that look on your face<br>
        And bring on all the pretenders<br>

        Elevator buttons and morning air<br>
        Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs<br>
        If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares<br>
        But right now, my time is theirs<br>
        Seems like there's always someone who disapproves<br>
        They'll judge it like they know about me and you<br>
        And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do<br>
        The jury's out, but my choice is you<br>
        <br>
        So don't you worry your pretty little mind<br>
        People throw rocks at things that shine<br>
        And life makes love look hard<br>
        The stakes are high, the water's rough<br>
        But this love is ours<br>

        You never know what people have up their sleeves<br>
        Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me<br>

        And life makes love look hard<br>
        The stakes are high, the water's rough<br>
        But this love is ours<br>
        <br>
        And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and<br>
        Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and<br>
        I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you<br>
        'Cause I love the gap between your teeth<br>
        And I love the riddles that you speak<br>
        And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos<br>
        Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours<br>
        <br>
        So don't you worry your pretty little mind<br>
        People throw rocks at things that shine<br>
        And life makes love look hard<br>
        Don't you worry your pretty little mind<br>

        They can't take what's ours<br>

        To save the world or go to work<br>
        It's the same thing to me<br>
        He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition<br>
        I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him<br>
        I hang on every word you say, yay<br>

        He's not all bad like his reputation<br>
        And I can't hear one single word they say<br>
        And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay<br>

        Closes the blinds and locks the door<br>
        When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom<br>
        Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong<br>
        She waits and takes her time<br>
        'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain<br>
        When Emma falls in love, I know<br>
        That boy will never be the same<br>

        'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down<br>

        Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A<br>
        She won't lose herself in love the way that I did<br>
        'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place<br>
        When Emma falls in love, I'm learning<br>
        <br>
        Emma met a boy with eyes like a man<br>
        Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand<br>
        Now he'll be her shelter when it rains<br>
        Little does he know, his whole world's about to change<br>

        And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh<br>
        That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor<br>
        I could see you, make me want you even more<br>
        What would you do? Baby, if you only knew<br>
        That I can see you, oh, I can see you<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I see you, I see you, baby<br>
        I see you<br>
        (Uh-uh, uh, uh) I see you, I see you, baby<br>
        Oh, baby<br>

        (Once, I had an empire)<br>
        (Once, I had an empire)<br>
        <br>
        Once, I had an empire in a golden age<br>
        I was held up so high, I used to be great<br>
        They used to cheer when they saw my face<br>
        Now, I fear I have fallen from grace<br>
        <br>
        And I feel like my castle's crumbling down<br>
        And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground<br>
        And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down<br>
        You don't wanna know me now<br>
        <br>
        Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty<br>
        Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me<br>
        Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far<br>
        I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart<br>
        <br>
        Power went to my head and I couldn't stop<br>
        Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off<br>
        And here I sit alone behind walls of regret<br>
        Falling down like promises that I never kept<br>
        <br>
        And I feel like my castle's crumbling down<br>
        And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground<br>
        And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down<br>
        You don't wanna know me now<br>
        <br>
        My foes and friends watch my reign end<br>
        I don't know how it could've ended this way<br>
        Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor<br>
        People look at me like I'm a monster<br>
        Now they're screamin' at the palace's front gates<br>
        Used to chant my name<br>
        Now they're screaming that they hate me<br>
        Never wanted you to hate me<br>
        <br>
        My castle's crumbling down<br>
        And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground<br>
        And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)<br>
        My castle's crumbling down<br>
        You don't wanna know me now, now<br>
        <br>
        (Once, I had an empire)<br>

        <br>
        My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand<br>
        Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans<br>
        And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again<br>
        You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high<br>
        Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right<br>
        And I will block out these voices of reason in my head<br>
        <br>
        And the voices say, "You are not the exception<br>
        You will never learn your lesson"<br>
        <br>
        Foolish one<br>
        Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love<br>
        That ain't never gonna come<br>
        You will take the long way, you will take the long way down<br>
        <br>
        You know how to keep me waitin'<br>
        I know how to act like I'm fine<br>
        Don't know what to call this situation<br>
        But I know I can't call you mine<br>
        And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof<br>
        'Cause when my head is on your shoulder<br>
        It starts thinkin' you'll come around<br>
        And maybe, someday, when we're older<br>
        This is something we'll laugh about<br>
        Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news<br>
        <br>
        But then the voices say, "You are not the exception<br>
        You will never learn your lesson"<br>
        <br>
        Foolish one<br>
        Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love<br>
        That ain't never gonna come<br>
        You will take the long way, you will take the long way down<br>
        Foolish one<br>
        Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love<br>
        That ain't never gonna come<br>
        You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out<br>
        <br>
        Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands<br>
        Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?"<br>
        Oh, you haven't written me or called<br>
        But goodbye screamin' in the silence<br>
        And the voices in my head are tellin' me why<br>
        'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings<br>
        I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring<br>
        And you will say you had the best of intentions<br>
        And maybe I will finally learn my lesson<br>
        <br>
        Foolish one<br>
        Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love<br>
        That ain't never gonna come<br>
        You will take the long way, you will take the long way down<br>
        Foolish one<br>
        Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love<br>
        That ain't never gonna come<br>
        You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh<br>
        La-la-la-la-la<br>
        Ain't never gonna come<br>
        Ooh, you will learn the hard way now<br>
        Foolish one<br>
        Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love<br>
        They ain't never gonna come<br>
        And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out<br>
        Foolish one<br>
        The day is gonna come for your confessions of love<br>
        When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one<br>
        No, he just wasn't the one<br>

        <h4>"Timeless (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"</h4>
        <br>
        Down the block, there's an antique shop<br>
        And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in<br>
        On the counter was a cardboard box<br>
        And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"<br>
        Black and white, saw a '30s bride<br>
        And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house<br>
        The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime<br>
        The kind you don't put down<br>
        And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain<br>
        But in those photos, I saw us instead<br>
        And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other<br>
        In another life, you still would've turned my head even if we'd met<br>
        <br>
        On a crowded street in 1944<br>
        And you were headed off to fight in the war<br>
        You still would've been mine<br>
        We would have been timeless<br>
        I would've read your love letters every single night<br>
        And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right<br>
        And you would've been fine<br>
        We would have been timeless<br>
        'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this<br>
        So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine<br>
        We would've been timeless<br>
        <br>
        I had to smile when it caught my eye<br>
        There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway<br>
        Holdin' hands on the way to a dance<br>
        And the date on the back said 1958<br>
        Which brought me back to the first time I saw you<br>
        Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop<br>
        I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round<br>
        At these precious things that time forgot<br>
        That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs<br>
        Story of a romance torn apart by fate<br>
        Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did<br>
        And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face<br>
        <br>
        In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land<br>
        And I was forced to marry another man<br>
        You still would've been mine<br>
        We would have been timeless<br>
        I would've read your love letters every single night<br>
        And run away and left it all behind<br>
        You still would've been mine<br>
        We would've been timeless<br>
        'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this<br>
        So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine<br>
        We would've been timeless<br>
        <br>
        Time breaks down your mind and body<br>
        Don't you let it touch your soul<br>
        It was like an age-old classic<br>
        The first time that you saw me<br>
        The story started when you said, "Hello"<br>
        <br>
        In a crowded room a few short years ago<br>
        And sometimes there's no proof, you just know<br>
        You're always gonna be mine<br>
        We're gonna be<br>
        I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray<br>
        We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made<br>
        And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"<br>
        <br>
        We're gonna be timeless, timeless<br>
        You still would've been mine<br>
        We would've been<br>
        Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944<br>
        You still would've been mine<br>
        We would've been<br>
        <br>
        Down the block, there's an antique shop<br>

        <h4>"If This Was A Movie (Taylor's Version)"</h4>
        <br>
        Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'<br>
        Sounded like footsteps on my stairs<br>
        Six months gone and I'm still reachin'<br>
        Even though I know you're not there<br>
        I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby<br>
        Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through<br>
        Maybe I've been going back too much lately<br>
        When time stood still and I had you<br>
        <br>
        Come back, come back, come back to me like<br>
        You would, you would if this was a movie<br>
        Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out<br>
        Come back, come back, come back to me like<br>
        You could, you could if you just said you're sorry<br>
        I know that we could work it out somehow<br>
        But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now<br>
        <br>
        I know people change and these things happen<br>
        But I remember how it was back then<br>
        Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'<br>
        'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them<br>
        Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street<br>
        Flashback to the night when you said to me<br>
        Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you<br>
        Back before I knew how much I had to lose<br>
        <br>
        Come back, come back, come back to me like<br>
        You would, you would if this was a movie<br>
        Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out<br>
        Come back, come back, come back to me like<br>
        You could, you could if you just said you're sorry<br>
        I know that we could work it out somehow<br>
        But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now<br>
        <br>
        If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on<br>
        I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone<br>
        I just want it back the way it was before<br>
        And I just wanna see you back at my front door<br>
        <br>
        And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like<br>
        You would before you said it's not that easy<br>
        Before the fight, before I locked you out<br>
        But I take it all back now"<br>
        <br>
        Come back, come back, come back to me like<br>
        You would, you would if this was a movie<br>
        Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out<br>
        Come back, come back, come back to me like<br>
        You could, you could if you just said you're sorry<br>
        I know that we could work it out somehow<br>
        But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now<br>
        <br>
        You'd be here by now<br>
        It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now<br>
        Baby, what about the ending?<br>
        Oh, I thought that you'd be here by now<br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        Thought you'd be here by now<br>
